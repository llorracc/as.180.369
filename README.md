## Course Description

This course combines two essential components for modern economic research: advanced research methods and statistical programming, applied towards the completion of a substantive term paper.

1.  **Econometrics and Machine Learning with Python (Mornings, 10:00am - 11:30am):** This part focuses on the practical implementation of econometric techniques and machine learning tools using Python, essential for rigorous empirical analysis. **This session will be held virtually via Zoom (link TBD).**
2.  **Tools for Writing a Research Paper in Economics (Afternoons, 1:00pm - 3:30pm):** Building on a topic selected early in the semester (likely from a previous course), this part guides students through the entire research process live and interactively. We will cover formulating a question, exploring relevant tools (like Google Scholar, ChatGPT, Wikipedia, LitMaps, PaperPile), structuring the paper, creating content (using Jupyter notebooks), managing the project (with GitHub), generating and incorporating figures and tables, and preparing slide presentations for presenting findings. **This session will be held in-person.**

Throughout the semester, each student (or student pair) will develop a research paper on their chosen topic. The course is hands-on, requiring laptops for interactive sessions (both virtual and in-person). Writing assignments will primarily take the form of Jupyter notebooks (or LaTeX for graduate students).

**Mandatory Mentoring:** In addition to class time, each student is required to schedule and attend a **one-hour meeting each week** with an assigned economist mentor to discuss their term paper progress. It is the student's responsibility to arrange this meeting at a mutually convenient time during the week.

## Course Requirements

Recommended Course Background: some familiarity with python or other modern programming
languages (though having taken a formal course in such a language is not required).

## Schedule

_Note: Class times/days vary. Please check carefully._

- the pitch: students will craft a compelling, challenging research pitch for their term paper
- the draft: students will learn about and explore common tools for research paper writing as they prepare the draft for their term paper
- the submission: students will get direct feedback for completing their term paper and readying it for publication or submission to a journal
- the presentation: students will craft a compelling presentation detailing the research done in process of writing their term paper

Note that the schedule above may shift as we progress through the course. Updates to due dates will be communicated to you by your instructor.

**This is a live document. Please refresh this page periodically to check for updates.**

## Grading

Your grade in this course will consist of four components:

- Research pitch (15%—due Tue Jun 10)
- Term paper submission (25%—due Fri Jul 18)
- Research presentation (30%—due Fri Jul 18)
- Course participation (30%—assessed overall)

Grading scale:
90 to 100   "A"
75 to 89     "B"
60 to 74     "C"

The last component ("course participation") will be assessed by your instructor based on the following factors:

- course attendance
- participation in course discussions
- regular check-ins & incremental deliverables (as directed by your instructor)
- **Completion of required weekly 1-hour mentor meetings**

## Policies

The below is a non-exclusive list of policies governing course procedure.

If you have any questions or concerns, it is your responsibility to promptly
bring them to the attention of the course instructor.

### Extensions & Late Work

Due dates for assignments will be communicated to you in advances by
your course instructor. If you have questions or confusion about
due dates or grading policy, please contact your instructor promptly.

Your instructor is the final word on matters governing this course (where
not otherwise superseded by university policy.)

If you need an extension for an assignment, communicate this (in
advance) to your instructor. We will make
accommodations on a case-by-case basis. We will take into consideration
whether your request for an extension was made at the last minute (≤48
hours prior to the due date,) and we reserve the right to deny your
request for an extension in accordance with university policy.

**Late assignments will be docked a grade for each day that they are late:
an A will become an A-; an A- will become a B.**

### Absences

We expect attendance at all in-person sessions of this course.

This is an in-person course, and you are expected to attend all sessions
in-person, unless you have requested and been granted accommodations (see [below](#accommodations))

In general, absences are excused for illness, religious observation,
participation in certain university activities, or there circumstances
described in university's policy. Since we expect the core work of what you do in this class to
be performed live in class, with your between-class assignments being about
how to improve what you have done in class, participation during course
sessions is essential to your performing well and getting the most out
of the class. As a result, if you miss more than one class that
not covered in one of the explicitly allowed reasons for excused absences,
your grade for the class will be reduced.

It is your responsibility to inform the instructor beforehand if
you will miss a class. Students MUST communicate with their instructor
regarding expected or unexpected absences.

Note that Howard University policy states:

> Students should consult with their instructors and/or TAs when they
> have missed classes to explain the reasons for their absence and to
> stay on track in the course. Instructors establish their own policies
> regarding attendance, and it is the student's responsibility to know
> those policies. In certain courses, regular attendance is given
> special importance. These include foreign language courses and the
> introductory courses in the Writing Seminars and Expository Writing.
> Instructors in these courses may lower a student's grade for unexcused
> absences.

### Academic Ethics

All graded work must be completed in accordance with Howard University's Academic Code of Student Conduct. In particular, plagiarism in any form is a violation of this code. Examples of plagiarism include:
- buying or borrowing a paper,
- copying a paper entirely or in part from any source,
- summarizing a source without adequate citation,
- using ChatGPT or other AI for writing graded work, and
- using thoughts (including wording) belonging to someone else without citation.

It is also a violation of the honor code if the research paper has been used in its entirety in another class. A previous paper of yours may be the basis for further research for the current course, but you must discuss this with and receive written approval from the instructors in advance. The Academic Code specifies consequences for violations. Prior to commencing this course, each student must read the university's Academic Code, which is available on university's website.

### Digital Etiquette

During class-time, please use digital devices such as cellphones, laptops, and tablets for only activities directly involving this class. Other uses (including email, texting, and web browsing) are distracting to your classmates and to the instructors. If you must respond to a phone call, email, or text, please leave the classroom to do so.

### COVID-19 Statement for Summer 2024

The indoor mask mandate has been lifted on campus for all faculty, staff, students, and visitors, with a notable exception like patient settings. Faculty may continue to require masks for individual classes. In those classes where a face mask is required, students will be directed to leave the classroom if a face mask is not worn properly to cover the nose and mouth. Any student who refuses or fails to comply with a specific classroom requirement to wear a face mask, and any other measures the University advances for the safety and protection of the Howard Community, will constitute a violation of the University's Student Code of Conduct and could result in sanctions up to and including expulsion from the University.
