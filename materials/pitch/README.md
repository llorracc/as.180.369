3. **CC, TA's** overview of term paper & process (15 mins): What is the overall goal of the term paper? What process will we follow? What do we want to accomplish through the pitch process?
4. [Sign up for 2 of the starting topics](https://github.com/llorracc/as.180.369/issues/1).

**Homework**
- Choose your 2 topics on Github

## Class 4: Research Pitches

[Zoom recording. Requires JHU login.](https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/personal/mzahn2_jh_edu/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fmzahn2%5Fjh%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FFall%202023%20AS%2E160%2E369%20Class%20Recordings%2F2023%2E09%2E25%20Class%204%2Emp4&nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJPbmVEcml2ZUZvckJ1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXciLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJNeUZpbGVzTGlua0RpcmVjdCJ9fQ&nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJPbmVEcml2ZUZvckJ1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXciLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJNeUZpbGVzTGlua0RpcmVjdCJ9fQ&ga=1)

You will create a pitch, consisting of any visual aid of your choice. The pitch
should be no longer than 5 minutes in duration and should convey the following
items:

- Exhibit understanding of existing literature around your topics (30%)
    - You will share your screen showing LitMaps results.
- Clear research question (25%)
    - Do you understand the topic you selected?
    - Were you able to articulate it as a research question?
- Preview/outline of what you plan to do to answer that question. (25%)
- Fit & finish (20%)
    - Visual aides should be clear, concise, and not too wordy.
    - Speaking style should slow and understandable.
    - All ideas conveyed within the time limit.

**Additional Guidelines**
- Optionally submit 1 or 2 visuals (e.g., slides, images, bullet points) to [CR](mailto:cameron@dutc.io) prior to Fri Sep 22.
- 10 minutes per student + 5 min Q&A + 5 min allocation (×7 students = 140 min)

**Homework**
- Choose two topics* from the JEP folder I shared (*or 1 topic from there and 1 topic of your own that you’re interested in) and 1 of the topics you chose on the list of topics on the Github issue (i.e. GDP Growth and political party in the US, or Inflation change and political party in the US)
- Make a Litmap for each topic (3 litmaps) so that you can get a sense of the literature that exists in the space (be thoughtful with which articles you add to the litmap)
  - Send me a screenshot of all 3 litmaps by class on Monday
- Once you have more of a grasp on each topic, write a paragraph about each of them and what potential research might look like for each of them
- Make at least 1 improvement to each paragraph using ChatGPT and commit the change so that I can see it in your history (with your ChatGPT prompt as the commit message).
- Be ready to present the two topics you’re most interested in to class on Monday
