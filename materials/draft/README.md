### Agenda
- Alan Lujan discussion on MyST
- Discuss best practices for the visual communication of quantitative information (60 min)
    - show video from previous semesters
    - [Visualization Lecture](https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/personal/mzahn2_jh_edu/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fmzahn2_jh_edu%2FDocuments%2FFall+2023+AS.160.369+Class+Recordings%2F2023.10.02+Class+5.mp4&startedResponseCatch=true&referrer=StreamWebApp.Web&referrerScenario=AddressBarCopied.view.e8ad06dc-b25b-4b6e-bf9b-876ddbaa1b3b)
- Go over template for final paper and what is expected (60 min)
   - [sample paper](materials/draft/emurinson-paper.ipynb)

**Helpful notes**
- Abstract:
    - Results you hope to get. Write as if you got the results you wanted that align with your hypothesis.
    - Note why people should care about your findings.
    - Tight: Less than 200 words.
- Introduction:
    - Longer than Abstract.
    - Position the paper in terms of our current understanding/debates on the subject.
    - Motivate why you are studying this topic and why it is important. Big pictire, what is the point of your paper.
    - Aim for about a page or a page and a half (~500 to 750 words).
    - Focus on writing well. The content is less important than the process and demonstration of using the tools to improve the content you generate.


### Homework
- Watch tutorial on GitHub practices [Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk)
  - Note: Use Jupyter Notebook instead of VS code 
- Continue working on the Literature Review and Abstract for final papers. Add what you have so far to MyST on Terminal.
- Include data visualization techniques reviewed in class to your analysis from last week. 
- Make a start on the introduction
