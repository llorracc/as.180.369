# Introduction

State film tax credit programs represent one of the most persistent policy puzzles in American economic development: despite decades of academic research finding limited and short-lived economic benefits, these programs continue to expand across states and consume billions in public funds annually. By 2022, over 30 states offered film production incentives, with total annual allocations exceeding $2 billion nationwide (Motion Picture Association, 2023). Yet the empirical literature, from Thom's (2018) comprehensive national analysis to Bradbury's (2020) aggregate growth studies, consistently finds that film tax credits produce minimal sustained employment gains and no measurable impact on broader state economic development.

California's entry into this competitive landscape came relatively late but with unprecedented scale. After decades of relying on its natural advantages—established infrastructure, talent pools, and favorable climate—California enacted its first Film and Television Tax Credit Program in 2009, allocating $100 million annually. This initial program, however, paled in comparison to the aggressive incentives offered by states like Louisiana, Georgia, and New York, which had been attracting major productions away from Hollywood for years. By 2013, California's share of national film production employment had declined substantially, prompting state policymakers to dramatically expand the program.

In 2015, California tripled its annual tax credit allocation to $330 million through Film Tax Credit Program 2.0 (AB 1839), making it the largest single-state film incentive program in the nation. Five years later, Program 3.0 further expanded allocations and extended the program through 2025, with total authorized credits reaching $1.55 billion over the five-year period. These expansions occurred during a transformative period for the industry: the rise of streaming platforms created unprecedented demand for content, while production technologies enabled more location flexibility than ever before. This convergence of large-scale policy intervention and industry transformation presents a critical test case for whether modern film tax credits can achieve their stated goals of retaining and growing production activity.

This paper examines whether California's Film Tax Credit Program 2.0 (effective FY2015–16) and Program 3.0 (credit allocations beginning July 1, 2020) generated sustained employment or wage gains in the state's motion picture industry. Building on Thom's (2018) national analysis of motion picture incentives (1998–2013), which found limited and short-lived effects, I use QCEW data for 2010–2025 and ACS migration microdata for 2009–2023 to capture California's more recent and significantly larger credit programs. This temporal extension is crucial: Thom's study ended in 2013, just before California's major 2015 expansion, leaving unanswered whether larger-scale, modernized programs produce stronger effects than the modest pre-2013 programs he analyzed.

The study addresses several methodological concerns raised in the literature. Rickman and Wang (2020) highlight a critical measurement issue: apparent employment gains in Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) data may reflect administrative reclassification of employees, temporary project hiring, or cross-state administrative shifts rather than genuine job creation. To address this "reclassification problem," I supplement QCEW-based employment analysis with American Community Survey (ACS) data on occupation-specific migration flows, testing whether observed employment increases correspond to actual worker inflows into California's film sector.

Using QCEW data for the motion picture and video production industry (NAICS 512110), I estimate difference-in-differences (DiD) models with two treatment onsets (2015 and 2020), comparing California against states with stable incentive policies and similar pre-trends. To improve counterfactual validity and address identification concerns, I further implement Synthetic Control Methods (SCM) following Rickman and Wang's (2020) recommendation. Finally, motivated by Owens and Rennhoff's (2024) analysis of political determinants of tax incentive adoption, I provide descriptive analysis of the political timing of California's program expansions relative to gubernatorial election cycles, assessing whether these policies align more closely with electoral incentives than economic outcomes.

The empirical findings reveal a nuanced picture. Synthetic control estimates show positive point estimates for employment (3-4% increases), but neither effect achieves statistical significance (p = 0.29 and p = 0.14, both > 0.05), meaning we cannot confidently conclude there was employment growth. Difference-in-differences analysis finds a substantial and statistically significant wage premium of 9.1% following the 2015 program expansion, indicating meaningful improvements in worker compensation. However, ACS migration data reveals persistent net inflow of film industry workers throughout the study period (2009-2023), with California gaining an average of 2,029 workers annually from other states. Yet this baseline inflow pattern did not meaningfully strengthen following the tax credit expansions—net inflow actually dipped in 2020-2021, with 2021 showing the smallest net inflow in the entire period. This creates a different puzzle: suggestive (but statistically insignificant) employment gains and a sustained net inflow of workers without a clear post-policy break in migration patterns, which can be understood through three mechanisms: (1) the baseline inflow pattern reflects California's existing attractiveness rather than policy effects, (2) increased work hours and opportunities for existing workers rather than new arrivals, and (3) temporary project-based relocations that are not captured in permanent migration data.

These findings suggest that California's film tax credits may have achieved their primary goal of retaining production activity and employment within the state, even if they did not meaningfully enhance the baseline net inflow pattern. The policy appears to have improved conditions for existing California film workers—through higher wages and more consistent employment—while partially mitigating the state's competitive disadvantage relative to other production hubs. However, the fact that net inflow did not strengthen following the tax credit expansions suggests that the tax credits were insufficient to substantially enhance California's competitive position beyond the existing baseline pattern.

By uniting administrative employment data, migration evidence, and political timing analysis, this study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of whether modern film tax credits in the streaming era produce genuine economic benefits or primarily serve political objectives. The results have implications for policymakers considering similar incentive programs and for understanding the broader dynamics of place-based economic development policies in an increasingly mobile economy.

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature on film tax credits, highlighting the temporal and methodological gaps this study addresses. Section 3 describes the data sources, empirical strategy, and identification assumptions. Section 4 presents the main results from difference-in-differences and synthetic control analyses, along with the migration validation evidence. Section 5 discusses the integrated interpretation of these findings and their policy implications. Section 6 concludes with a summary of contributions and directions for future research.
