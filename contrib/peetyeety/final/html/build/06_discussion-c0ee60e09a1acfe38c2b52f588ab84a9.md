## Interpretation in Context of Existing Literature

This study finds no statistically significant evidence that California's film tax credits increased employment. The SCM results (p = 0.286 and p = 0.143) fail to reject the null hypothesis, consistent with the broader literature's finding that film incentives produce limited measurable effects (Thom 2018; Button 2019; Bradbury 2020).

The significant wage premium (9.1% for 2015, p = 0.003) represents a notable exception. While Thom found that refundable credits temporarily raise wages, California's persistent wage effect may reflect its transferable credit structure. However, this finding must be interpreted cautiously given DiD's parallel trends violations.

The ACS migration evidence reveals persistent net inflow throughout 2009-2023, but this baseline pattern did not strengthen after tax credit expansions—net inflow actually declined in 2020-2021. This addresses Rickman and Wang's (2020) concern about distinguishing genuine job creation from administrative reclassification.

## Methodological Considerations

The contrast between DiD (negative effects) and SCM (positive effects) highlights method selection importance. DiD's parallel trends violation—Georgia's rapid pre-treatment growth—biases estimates. SCM addresses this by optimally weighting New York (100%) as the counterfactual, but limited donor pool size (n = 6) constrains statistical power.

The ACS analysis introduces its own challenges: it captures permanent moves but may miss temporary project-based relocations common in film production, potentially understating production activity effects.

## Policy Implications

The evidence suggests California's tax credits did not generate detectable employment growth. The wage premium indicates improved compensation for existing workers, but the failure to enhance baseline migration patterns suggests the programs functioned as defensive policy—maintaining existing advantages—rather than expanding production.

This interpretation aligns with Owens and Rennhoff's (2024) finding that film tax credits persist for political rather than purely economic reasons. Visible benefits to existing workers may provide sufficient political justification even absent broader development goals.

## Limitations

1. Statistical power constraints limit definitive conclusions
2. Lack of program expenditure data prevents cost-effectiveness analysis
3. Analysis focuses on aggregate effects, not heterogeneous impacts by production type or occupation

Future research should expand donor pools, obtain expenditure data for cost-per-job calculations, and explore alternative data sources capturing temporary migration patterns.
