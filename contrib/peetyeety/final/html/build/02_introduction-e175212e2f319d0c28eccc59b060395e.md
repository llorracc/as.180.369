# Introduction

State film tax credit programs represent one of the most persistent policy puzzles in American economic development: despite decades of academic research finding limited and short-lived economic benefits, these programs continue to expand across states and consume billions in public funds annually. By 2022, over 30 states offered film production incentives, with total annual allocations exceeding 2 billion dollars nationwide. Yet the empirical literature, from Thom's (2018) comprehensive national analysis to Bradbury's (2020) aggregate growth studies, consistently finds that film tax credits produce minimal sustained employment gains and no measurable impact on broader state economic development.

California's entry into this competitive landscape came relatively late but with unprecedented scale. After decades of relying on its natural advantages—established infrastructure, talent pools, and favorable climate—California enacted its first Film and Television Tax Credit Program in 2009, allocating 100 million dollars annually. This initial program, however, paled in comparison to the aggressive incentives offered by states like Louisiana, Georgia, and New York, which had been attracting major productions away from Hollywood for years. By 2013, California's share of national film production employment had declined substantially, prompting state policymakers to dramatically expand the program.

In 2015, California tripled its annual tax credit allocation to 330 million dollars through Film and Television Tax Credit Program 2.0 (AB 1839), making it the largest single-state film incentive program in the nation. Five years later, Program 3.0 further expanded allocations and extended the program through 2025, with total authorized credits reaching 1.55 billion dollars over the five-year period. These expansions occurred during a transformative period for the industry: the rise of streaming platforms created unprecedented demand for content, while production technologies enabled more location flexibility than ever before.

This paper examines whether California's Film and Television Tax Credit Program 2.0 (effective FY2015–16) and Program 3.0 (credit allocations beginning July 1, 2020) generated sustained employment or wage gains in the state's motion picture industry. Building on Thom's (2018) national analysis of motion picture incentives (1998–2013), I use QCEW data for 2010–2025 and ACS migration microdata for 2009–2023 to capture California's more recent and significantly larger credit programs.

The study addresses several methodological concerns raised in the literature. Rickman and Wang (2020) highlight that apparent employment gains in QCEW data may reflect administrative reclassification rather than genuine job creation. To address this "reclassification problem," I supplement QCEW-based employment analysis with ACS data on occupation-specific migration flows. Using NAICS 512110 data, I estimate difference-in-differences (DiD) and Synthetic Control Methods (SCM) with two treatment onsets (2015 and 2020). Finally, motivated by Owens and Rennhoff (2023), I analyze the political timing of California's program expansions relative to gubernatorial election cycles.

The empirical findings are clear: **no statistically significant employment effects were detected** (SCM p-values of 0.286 and 0.143). The only significant finding is a 9.1% wage premium following the 2015 expansion (p = 0.003). ACS migration data shows persistent net inflow of film workers throughout 2009-2023, but this baseline pattern did not strengthen after tax credit expansions. Political timing analysis reveals both expansions were enacted in gubernatorial election years within months of Election Day.

These findings suggest California's film tax credits functioned as defensive policy—improving conditions for existing workers—rather than generating net job creation. By uniting administrative employment data, migration evidence, and political timing analysis, this study contributes to understanding whether modern film tax credits produce genuine economic benefits or primarily serve political objectives.

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 describes data sources and empirical strategy. Section 4 presents results. Section 5 discusses interpretation and policy implications. Section 6 concludes.
