# Conclusion

This study examined whether California's Film and Television Tax Credit Program 2.0 (effective FY2015–16) and Program 3.0 (credit allocations beginning July 1, 2020) generated sustained employment or wage gains in the motion picture industry, extending Thom's (2018) temporal scope and addressing methodological concerns raised by Rickman and Wang (2020).

## Key Findings

**No statistically significant employment effects were detected.** SCM estimates show positive point estimates (3-4%) but p-values of 0.29 and 0.14 exceed conventional significance thresholds. We cannot conclude the programs increased employment.

**A significant wage premium was identified.** DiD analysis found a 9.1% wage increase following Program 2.0 (p = 0.003), indicating improved compensation for existing workers.

**Migration patterns did not respond to policy.** ACS data shows persistent net inflow of film workers (average +2,029/year), but this baseline pattern did not strengthen after tax credit expansions—net inflow actually declined in 2020-2021.

**Political timing suggests electoral motivations.** Both expansions were enacted in gubernatorial election years within months of Election Day—a pattern unlikely to be coincidental (~1.6% probability if random).

## Contributions

1. **Temporal extension:** First analysis of California's large-scale 2015 and 2020 programs
2. **Methodological rigor:** SCM addresses DiD parallel trends violations; ACS migration data addresses the "reclassification problem"
3. **Political economy context:** Links null employment effects to electoral incentive structures

## Policy Implications

California's film tax credits appear to function as defensive policy—maintaining wages for existing workers and slowing competitive decline—rather than generating net job creation. The 1.55 billion dollars authorized for Program 3.0 did not detectably expand employment or enhance the state's ability to attract workers beyond baseline patterns.

The persistence of these programs despite null employment effects is consistent with Owens and Rennhoff's (2024) finding that film tax credits serve political rather than purely economic objectives.

## Final Assessment

The evidence paints a clear picture: California's film tax credits did not produce statistically significant employment growth. They improved wages for existing workers but failed to fundamentally alter the state's competitive position. As states continue competing through increasingly generous incentives, California's experience suggests these programs may be more effective at preventing losses than generating gains—raising important questions about their role in economic development strategy.
