# Conclusion

This study examined whether California's Film and Television Tax Credit Program 2.0 (2015) and Program 3.0 (2020) generated sustained employment or wage gains in the state's motion picture industry. By extending Thom's (2018) temporal scope to capture California's large-scale, modernized programs and addressing methodological concerns raised by Rickman and Wang (2020), this research provides new evidence on the effectiveness of film tax credits in the streaming era.

## Summary of Findings

The analysis employed three complementary approaches—difference-in-differences, synthetic control methods, and migration validation—to evaluate the policy's impact. The synthetic control estimates, which provide the most credible causal inference given DiD's parallel trends violations, suggest modest employment increases of 3-4% following both tax credit expansions. While these effects do not achieve conventional statistical significance due to limited statistical power, they approach marginal significance and rank among the most extreme effects in placebo test distributions.

The difference-in-differences analysis identified a substantial and statistically significant wage premium of 9.1% following the 2015 program expansion, indicating meaningful improvements in worker compensation. However, ACS migration data reveals persistent net inflow of film industry workers throughout the study period (2009-2023), with California gaining an average of 2,029 workers annually from other states. Crucially, this net inflow pattern did not meaningfully strengthen after the tax credit expansions—net inflow actually declined in 2020-2021, with 2021 exhibiting the smallest net inflow in the series.

These findings can be understood through several mechanisms: (1) the baseline net inflow pattern reflects California's existing attractiveness rather than policy effects, (2) increased work hours and opportunities for existing workers rather than new arrivals, and (3) temporary project-based relocations that are not captured in permanent migration data. The integrated interpretation suggests that California's film tax credits achieved partial success in retaining production activity and improving conditions for existing workers, but they did not meaningfully enhance the baseline net inflow pattern or fundamentally alter the state's competitive position relative to other production hubs.

## Contributions

This study makes several contributions to the literature on film tax credits and place-based economic development policies. First, it extends the temporal scope of existing research to capture California's large-scale, modernized programs implemented during the streaming content boom, addressing a key gap identified in Thom's (2018) analysis. Second, it directly addresses Rickman and Wang's (2020) "reclassification problem" by supplementing administrative employment data with migration evidence, demonstrating that apparent job gains may reflect increased work for existing workers rather than genuine worker relocation. Third, it highlights the importance of method selection in policy evaluation, showing how SCM can provide more credible causal inference than DiD when parallel trends assumptions are violated.

The findings also contribute to understanding the broader dynamics of place-based economic development policies. The evidence suggests that film tax credits may function more effectively as defensive policies—maintaining existing advantages and improving conditions for existing workers—than as offensive strategies to substantially expand production. This interpretation aligns with Owens and Rennhoff's (2024) finding that film tax credits persist for political rather than purely economic reasons, as visible benefits to existing workers may provide sufficient political justification even if the policy fails to achieve broader economic development goals.

## Policy Implications

The results have several implications for policymakers considering similar incentive programs. First, the modest employment effects and the fact that net inflow did not strengthen following the tax credit expansions suggest that film tax credits may be insufficient to fundamentally alter a state's competitive position in an increasingly mobile industry. Second, the substantial wage premiums indicate that the policy may have meaningful benefits for existing workers, even if it does not generate net job creation. Third, the evidence suggests that tax credits may be more effective as defensive policies to maintain existing advantages than as offensive strategies to substantially expand production.

For California specifically, the findings suggest that while the tax credit programs may have helped maintain the state's competitive position and improved conditions for existing film workers, they did not meaningfully enhance the baseline net inflow pattern. This raises questions about whether the substantial public investment—$1.55 billion authorized for Program 3.0 alone—represents the most cost-effective approach to supporting the state's film industry.

## Limitations and Future Research

Several limitations should be acknowledged. The statistical power constraints in the SCM analysis limit the ability to draw definitive conclusions, and the lack of program expenditure data prevents cost-effectiveness analysis. The analysis focuses on aggregate industry-level effects and does not explore heterogeneous impacts across different types of productions, occupations, or regions within California.

Future research should address these gaps by expanding the donor pool if possible, obtaining detailed program expenditure data for cost-per-job calculations, and exploring heterogeneous effects by production type or occupation. Additionally, alternative data sources that capture temporary migration patterns could provide a more complete picture of the policy's impact on production activity.

## Final Thoughts

The evidence from this study paints a nuanced picture of California's film tax credit programs: modest positive employment effects and substantial wage improvements that primarily reflect improved retention and working conditions for existing workers rather than net in-migration. While the policy appears to have partially achieved its goal of retaining production activity within the state, it did not fundamentally reverse California's competitive decline relative to other production hubs.

These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of whether modern film tax credits in the streaming era produce genuine economic benefits or primarily serve political objectives. The persistent gap between policy promises and empirical evidence suggests that policymakers should carefully evaluate the costs and benefits of film tax credit programs, considering both their potential to improve conditions for existing workers and their limited ability to generate net job creation or reverse competitive trends.

As states continue to compete for film production through increasingly generous tax incentives, the evidence from California's experience suggests that these programs may be more effective at preventing losses than generating gains, raising important questions about their role in economic development strategy. The challenge for policymakers is to balance the visible benefits to existing workers against the substantial public costs, while recognizing that tax credits alone may be insufficient to fundamentally alter a state's competitive position in an increasingly mobile industry.
