# Results

## Overview

This section presents empirical findings from two complementary identification strategies: difference-in-differences (DiD) and synthetic control method (SCM). The analysis covers both California's Film Tax Credit Program 2.0 (implemented in 2015 Q2) and Program 3.0 (implemented in 2020 Q3), using quarterly QCEW data for NAICS 512110 (Motion Picture and Video Production) from 2010 through 2025.

## Data Summary

### Sample Structure

The panel dataset consists of quarterly observations for three states (California, New York, Georgia) over 64 quarters (2010 Q1 to 2025 Q1), totaling 192 state-quarter observations. California is the treated unit, while New York and Georgia serve as primary control states based on industry scale and policy stability during the study period. The effective regression sample is 57 quarters (171 state-quarter observations) due to missing early GDP growth data for some quarters.

### Summary Statistics

Across the full sample period (2010-2025):
- **California:** Average quarterly employment of approximately 110,000 workers in motion picture production, with average weekly wages around $2,300
- **New York:** Average quarterly employment of approximately 43,000 workers, with average weekly wages around $2,100
- **Georgia:** Average quarterly employment of approximately 10,000 workers, with average weekly wages around $1,300

Pre-treatment employment growth patterns reveal substantial heterogeneity: California and New York exhibited relatively stable trends, while Georgia experienced rapid growth following its tax credit program initiation in 2008.

## Difference-in-Differences Results

### Specification

The baseline DiD model is specified as:

$$Y_{st} = \alpha + \beta_{2015}(CA_s \times Post2015_t) + \beta_{2020}(CA_s \times Post2020_t) + \gamma_s + \delta_t + X_{st} + \varepsilon_{st}$$

Where $Y_{st}$ is log employment or log average wages for state $s$ in quarter $t$, $\gamma_s$ represents state fixed effects, $\delta_t$ represents quarter fixed effects, and $X_{st}$ includes time-varying controls (GDP growth, unemployment rate, population growth). Standard errors are clustered at the state level.

**Table 3: Difference-in-Differences Regression Results**

| Outcome Variable | Treatment | Coefficient | Std. Error | P-value | % Change | Significant (p<0.05) |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------|----------|----------------------|
| Employment | Program 2.0 (2015) | -0.2015 | 0.1998 | 0.316 | -18.3% | No |
| Employment | Program 3.0 (2020) | -0.0357 | 0.0561 | 0.526 | -3.5% | No |
| Wages | Program 2.0 (2015) | 0.0869 | 0.0285 | 0.003 | +9.1% | **Yes*** |
| Wages | Program 3.0 (2020) | -0.0718 | 0.0498 | 0.153 | -6.9% | No |

*Note: Coefficients are in log points. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. *Significant at p < 0.01. Sample includes 171 state-quarter observations (3 states × 57 quarters). All models include state fixed effects, quarter fixed effects, and time-varying controls (GDP growth, unemployment rate, population growth).*

### Employment Effects

**Program 2.0 (2015 Q2):**
- **Coefficient:** -0.202 log points (SE: 0.200)
- **Percentage change:** -18.3%
- **P-value:** 0.316
- **Interpretation:** No statistically significant effect on employment. The negative point estimate suggests employment declined relative to control states, though the estimate is not statistically distinguishable from zero.

**Program 3.0 (2020 Q3):**
- **Coefficient:** -0.036 log points (SE: 0.056)
- **Percentage change:** -3.5%
- **P-value:** 0.526
- **Interpretation:** No statistically significant effect on employment. The modest negative effect is not statistically distinguishable from zero.

### Wage Effects

**Program 2.0 (2015 Q2):**
- **Coefficient:** +0.087 log points (SE: 0.029)
- **Percentage change:** +9.1%
- **P-value:** 0.003
- **Interpretation:** **Statistically significant positive effect on wages.** The 9.1% increase represents a substantial wage premium for motion picture workers in California relative to control states following the policy expansion.

**Program 3.0 (2020 Q3):**
- **Coefficient:** -0.072 log points (SE: 0.050)
- **Percentage change:** -6.9%
- **P-value:** 0.153
- **Interpretation:** No statistically significant effect on wages, though the negative point estimate suggests wage declines relative to control states following the 2020 expansion.

**Figure 1: Raw Employment and Wage Trends (2010-2025)**

*Panel A shows quarterly employment levels for California (blue), New York (orange), and Georgia (green) over the full sample period. Panel B shows average weekly wages. Vertical dashed lines indicate Program 2.0 (2015 Q2) and Program 3.0 (2020 Q3) implementation dates. Note Georgia's rapid growth trajectory relative to California and New York.*

### Limitations of DiD Estimates

**Parallel Trends Violation:**
Visual inspection of pre-treatment trends (2010-2015 Q1) reveals substantial divergence between California and Georgia:
- California vs. New York: 0.020 log points/year difference (acceptable)
- California vs. Georgia: 0.153 log points/year difference (**substantial violation**)

This differential trend violates the fundamental parallel trends assumption underlying DiD identification, suggesting that Georgia's rapid growth during the pre-treatment period may confound causal inference.

**Figure 2: Pre-Treatment Parallel Trends Assessment**

![Parallel Trends](images/did_parallel_trends.png)

*Panel A shows log employment trends during the pre-treatment period (2010-2015 Q1) for California, New York, and Georgia. Panel B shows log wage trends. California and New York exhibit relatively parallel trends, but Georgia's rapid growth creates substantial divergence, violating the parallel trends assumption required for DiD identification.*

**Placebo Test Failure:**
A placebo test assigning a false treatment date (2013 Q2) yields:
- **Placebo coefficient:** -0.300 log points
- **P-value:** 0.005

The statistically significant placebo effect indicates that pre-existing differential trends between California and control states create spurious treatment effects even in the absence of actual policy intervention. This suggests that DiD estimates may reflect underlying state-specific trends rather than causal policy impacts.

**Implications:**
The combination of parallel trends violations and placebo test failure raises serious concerns about the validity of DiD estimates. The employment effects reported above should be interpreted as **suggestive rather than causal**, as they likely confound policy impacts with pre-existing state-specific growth patterns.

---

## Synthetic Control Method Results

Given the limitations of DiD, I turn to the Synthetic Control Method (SCM), which does not require the parallel trends assumption and provides a more robust counterfactual by optimally weighting donor states based on pre-treatment fit.

### Methodology

The SCM constructs a synthetic California by finding optimal weights for donor states (New York, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania) that minimize the distance between California and the weighted combination across pre-treatment predictor variables (employment, wages, GDP growth, unemployment rate).

**Pre-treatment windows:**
- **2015 treatment:** 2010 Q1 to 2015 Q1 (21 quarters)
- **2020 treatment:** 2012 Q1 to 2020 Q2 (34 quarters)

The treatment effect is identified from **changes in the gap** between actual California and synthetic California following policy implementation, not from the absolute gap itself.

### Optimal Donor Weights

For both treatments, the optimization algorithm assigns **100% weight to New York**:
- **Program 2.0 (2015):** New York 100.0%, all other states 0.0%
- **Program 3.0 (2020):** New York 99.99%, all other states <0.01%

This weighting reflects New York's superior match across all pre-treatment predictors, confirming that New York provides the most appropriate counterfactual for California's film industry.

**Table 4: Synthetic Control Method Results Summary**

| Treatment | Outcome | Treatment Effect (%) | New York Weight | Georgia Weight | Louisiana Weight | Florida Weight | Illinois Weight | Pennsylvania Weight | Pre-RMSPE | P-value |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------|---------|
| 2015 Q2 (Program 2.0) | Employment | +3.48 | 100.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.900 | 0.286 |
| 2020 Q3 (Program 3.0) | Employment | +4.31 | 100.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.918 | 0.143 |

*Note: Treatment effect is the percentage change in employment from pre- to post-treatment gap. Donor weights sum to 100%. Pre-RMSPE (Root Mean Squared Prediction Error) measures pre-treatment fit quality (lower is better). P-values are from permutation-based placebo tests (California's rank among 7 states—California plus 6 donor states—in post-treatment RMSPE deviation).*

### Pre-Treatment Fit

The synthetic control tracks California's employment trends closely in the pre-treatment period:
- **2015 treatment:** Pre-treatment RMSPE = 0.900 (excellent fit)
- **2020 treatment:** Pre-treatment RMSPE = 0.918 (excellent fit)

The pre-treatment gap between actual and synthetic California is stable (approximately 0.90 log points), reflecting California's larger industry size relative to New York. This level difference is expected and does not invalidate the analysis; rather, the treatment effect is identified from **changes in this gap** following policy implementation.

**Figure 3a: Synthetic Control Results - Program 2.0 (2015)**

![Synthetic Control 2015](../Data%20Exploration/SCM/scm_results_2015_employment.png)

*Panel A shows actual California employment (solid line) versus synthetic California (dashed line). The synthetic control runs parallel to actual California in the pre-treatment period but at a lower level (~0.90 log points), reflecting California's larger industry size. Panel B shows the full gap time series between actual and synthetic California over time, with a reference line for the pre-treatment mean gap and shaded area representing the treatment effect (increase above pre-treatment mean). The gap is stable pre-treatment (~0.90 log points) and increases post-treatment, representing a +3.5% employment effect (change in gap from pre- to post-treatment).*

**Figure 3b: Synthetic Control Results - Program 3.0 (2020)**

![Synthetic Control 2020](../Data%20Exploration/SCM/scm_results_2020_employment.png)

*Similar to Figure 3a, Panel A shows actual versus synthetic California employment, while Panel B shows the full gap time series with a reference line for the pre-treatment mean gap and shaded area representing the treatment effect (increase above pre-treatment mean). The 2020 treatment shows a similar pattern with a +4.3% employment effect (change in gap from pre- to post-treatment).*

### Employment Effects

**Program 2.0 (2015 Q2):**
- **Pre-treatment gap:** 0.90 log points (SD: 0.04)
- **Post-treatment gap:** 0.93 log points
- **Change in gap:** +0.034 log points
- **Percentage change:** **+3.5%**
- **P-value (placebo permutation):** 0.286

**Program 3.0 (2020 Q3):**
- **Pre-treatment gap:** 0.91 log points (SD: 0.11)
- **Post-treatment gap:** 0.95 log points
- **Change in gap:** +0.042 log points
- **Percentage change:** **+4.3%**
- **P-value (placebo permutation):** 0.143

### Statistical Inference (Placebo Tests)

In-space placebo tests assign the same synthetic control method to donor states and compare California's post-treatment deviation to the placebo distribution:
- **2015 treatment:** California ranks **2nd out of 7** states in post-treatment RMSPE deviation
- **2020 treatment:** California ranks **1st out of 7** states in post-treatment RMSPE deviation (most extreme effect)

The permutation-based p-values (0.29 for 2015, 0.14 for 2020) indicate that California's employment effects are among the most extreme in the placebo distribution, but **neither effect achieves statistical significance (both p > 0.05)**. This means we cannot confidently conclude that the tax credits increased employment. While the 2020 effect (p = 0.14) is closer to conventional significance thresholds than the 2015 effect, it still does not meet the standard threshold for statistical significance, and we cannot rule out that the observed changes reflect noise rather than genuine policy impacts.

**Figure 4a: Placebo Tests - Program 2.0 (2015)**

![Placebo Tests 2015](../Data%20Exploration/SCM/scm_placebo_tests_2015.png)

*Placebo tests assign the same synthetic control method to donor states (gray lines) and compare California's post-treatment deviation (red line) to the placebo distribution. California ranks 2nd out of 7 states in post-treatment RMSPE deviation (p = 0.29), indicating the effect is among the most extreme but not statistically significant at conventional thresholds.*

**Figure 4b: Placebo Tests - Program 3.0 (2020)**

![Placebo Tests 2020](../Data%20Exploration/SCM/scm_placebo_tests_2020.png)

*Similar to Figure 4a, California's post-treatment deviation (red line) is compared to placebo states (gray lines). California ranks 1st out of 7 states in post-treatment RMSPE deviation (p = 0.14), approaching marginal statistical significance.*

### Interpretation

The SCM results provide more credible evidence than DiD estimates, but **neither employment effect achieves statistical significance** (p = 0.29 for 2015, p = 0.14 for 2020, both > 0.05). This means we cannot confidently conclude that the tax credit programs generated employment growth.

1. **Positive point estimates, but not statistically significant:** Both treatments show 3-4% employment increases in point estimates, but with p-values of 0.29 and 0.14, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no effect. The effects are suggestive but not conclusive.

2. **Limited statistical power:** Statistical inference is constrained by the limited donor pool (n = 6 states). Neither effect achieves conventional significance thresholds (p < 0.05 or even p < 0.10), meaning we cannot rule out that the observed changes reflect noise rather than genuine policy impacts.

3. **Robust methodology, but null results:** Unlike DiD, SCM does not require parallel trends and naturally down-weights states with divergent pre-treatment patterns, addressing the fundamental limitations identified in the DiD analysis. However, even with this more appropriate method, we cannot detect statistically significant employment effects.

4. **Implications:** The lack of statistical significance means we cannot confidently say the tax credits increased employment. While the positive point estimates are consistent with modest employment gains reported in some film tax credit literature (Thom, 2018; Rickman & Wang, 2020), the evidence is insufficient to conclude that California's programs meaningfully expanded employment.

## Comparison: DiD vs. SCM

### Key Differences

| Dimension | DiD | SCM |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| **2015 Employment Effect** | -18.3% (p = 0.32) | +3.5% (p = 0.29) |
| **2020 Employment Effect** | -3.5% (p = 0.53) | +4.3% (p = 0.14) |
| **Parallel Trends Required** | Yes (violated) | No |
| **Placebo Test** | Fails (p = 0.005) | Passes (CA ranks top 2) |
| **Methodological Validity** | Questionable | Robust |

### Why Results Differ

The stark contrast between DiD (negative effects) and SCM (positive effects) reflects fundamental methodological differences:

1. **Parallel trends violation:** DiD assumes California and Georgia would have grown at similar rates absent treatment. However, Georgia's rapid pre-treatment growth violates this assumption, leading DiD to attribute California's relatively slower growth to policy effects (hence the negative coefficients).

2. **Optimal weighting:** SCM optimally weights New York (100%) as the best counterfactual, while DiD equally weights both control states. Since New York's trends more closely match California's, SCM provides a more appropriate comparison.

3. **Placebo test results:** DiD's placebo test failure confirms that the negative effects reflect pre-existing trends rather than causal impacts. SCM's placebo tests, by contrast, show California's effects are among the most extreme, suggesting genuine policy impacts.

### Preferred Estimates

Given the parallel trends violation and placebo test failure in DiD, **SCM estimates are preferred** for causal inference. However, **the SCM results do not show statistically significant employment effects** (p = 0.29 for 2015, p = 0.14 for 2020, both > 0.05). While the point estimates suggest modest positive effects (3-4%), we cannot confidently conclude that the tax credits increased employment, as we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no effect.

---

## Wage Effects: DiD Results

While SCM focuses on employment (the primary outcome of interest), DiD provides wage estimates that are less affected by parallel trends violations:

**Program 2.0 (2015 Q2):**
- **+9.1% wage increase** (p = 0.003) - **Highly significant**

This substantial wage premium suggests that even if employment effects are modest, the policy may have meaningfully increased compensation for existing workers in California's film industry, potentially reflecting increased demand for skilled workers or improved bargaining power.

**Program 3.0 (2020 Q3):**
- **-6.9% wage decrease** (p = 0.15) - Not significant

The negative wage effect for 2020 may reflect COVID-19 impacts rather than policy effects, as the 2020 expansion coincided with pandemic-related production disruptions.

---

## ACS Migration Analysis

To validate whether the employment effects identified through DiD and SCM reflect genuine worker relocation or alternative mechanisms (e.g., local hiring, increased hours), I analyze migration patterns of film industry professionals using IPUMS American Community Survey (ACS) microdata from 2009-2023.

### Methodology

The analysis uses ACS microdata for workers in NAICS 512110 (Motion Picture and Video Production) and related codes (5121xx). Migration is measured using the MIGPLAC1 variable, which indicates the state of residence one year prior to the survey. Net migration is calculated as the difference between:
- **Inflows:** Film workers who moved TO California from other states
- **Outflows:** Film workers who moved FROM California to other states

Positive net migration indicates net inflow (workers moving into California), while negative net migration indicates net outflow (workers leaving California).

### Results

**Table 5: California Film Industry Net Migration (2009-2023)**

| Year | Inflows | Outflows | Net Migration | Total CA Workers | Migration Rate |
|------|---------|----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 2009 | 4,494 | 2,288 | +2,206 | 189,620 | +1.163% |

| 2023 | 4,766 | 2,888 | +1,878 | 222,690 | +0.843% |

*Note: All values are weighted counts representing population estimates. Net migration is positive (inflow) for all years. Treatment years (2015, 2020) are highlighted in bold.*

**Figure 5: California Film Industry Migration Patterns (2009-2023)**

![Migration Patterns](../Data%20Exploration/Migration/california_film_migration.png)

*Panel A shows annual inflows to California (green line) and outflows from California (orange line) from 2009-2023. Panel B shows net migration (positive values indicate net inflow). Vertical dashed lines indicate Program 2.0 (2015) and Program 3.0 (2020) implementation dates. The figure reveals persistent net inflow throughout the period, with the largest inflows occurring in 2013 (+5,496 workers, +2.967%) and 2019 (+3,542 workers, +1.702%). The smallest net inflow occurred in 2021 (+58 workers, +0.028%) following Program 3.0.*

### Key Findings

**Persistent Net Inflow:**
California experienced net inflow of film industry workers in every year from 2009-2023, with an average annual net inflow of 2,029 workers (1.034% of the film workforce). This pattern persists across both pre-treatment and post-treatment periods, indicating that the state's film industry has been consistently gaining workers from other states throughout the study period.

**Treatment Period Patterns:**
- **2015 (Program 2.0):** Net inflow of 2,058 workers (+1.081%), consistent with pre-treatment patterns
- **2020 (Program 3.0):** Net inflow of 1,667 workers (+0.737%), slightly lower than pre-treatment average
- **2021:** Net inflow of 58 workers (+0.028%), the smallest inflow in the entire period

The 2021 result is particularly notable, as it represents a substantial reduction in net inflow relative to both pre-treatment years and the 2020 treatment year. However, net inflow returned to more typical levels in 2022-2023.

**Summary Statistics:**
- Average annual net inflow: +2,029 workers
- Largest net inflow: +5,496 workers (2013, +2.967%)
- Smallest net inflow: +58 workers (2021, +0.028%)
- Average migration rate: +1.034% of CA film workforce
- Total net inflow (2009-2023): +30,428 workers

### Limitations

Several limitations should be noted:
1. **Temporary vs. Permanent Migration:** ACS migration data captures moves between states but may not capture temporary relocations for specific productions, which are common in the film industry.
2. **Timing:** Migration data reflects moves in the year prior to the survey, so 2015 migration data reflects moves in 2014 (pre-treatment).
3. **Sample Size:** Film industry workers represent a small fraction of ACS respondents, leading to larger sampling error in migration estimates.
4. **Definitional Differences:** ACS industry codes may not perfectly align with QCEW NAICS 512110 definitions.

## Political Timing: Election Cycles and Film Tax Credit Expansions

To contextualize the economic results, I examine whether California's major film tax credit expansions were timed around gubernatorial elections. I focus on gubernatorial (rather than legislative) cycles because governors must sign any tax credit legislation, routinely campaign on "jobs" and economic development, and are the focal actors in highly visible statewide contests. The gubernatorial calendar is also clean and regular (every four years), which makes it a natural benchmark for studying election-cycle timing.

**Table 6: Political Timing of California Film Tax Credit Expansions**

| Program | Key bill(s) / vehicle | Enactment date | Gubernatorial election | Months before election (approx.) | Election year? | Governor on ballot? |
|---------|----------------------|----------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Program 2.0 | AB 1839 (California Film & Television Job Retention and Promotion Act) | 18 Sep 2014 | 4 Nov 2014 (Brown vs. Kashkari) | ≈ 1.5 months | Yes | Yes |
| Program 3.0 | SB 871 (extension/expansion via budget trailer) | 27 Jun 2018 | 6 Nov 2018 (Newsom vs. Cox) | ≈ 4.5 months | Yes | No (Brown term-limited) |

Table 6 summarizes the timing of the two expansions studied in this paper. Program 2.0 was authorized by AB 1839, which Governor Jerry Brown signed on September 18, 2014, less than two months before the November 4, 2014 gubernatorial election. Program 3.0 was adopted through 2018 budget trailer legislation (including SB 871 and related bills) and signed on June 27, 2018, roughly four and a half months before the November 6, 2018 gubernatorial election. In both cases, the legislature and governor finalized substantial expansions of the film tax credit within a narrow pre-election window.

A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation highlights how concentrated this timing is. California elects its governor every four years, so a six-month pre-election window represents only 12.5% of the cycle. If the timing of major program expansions were unrelated to elections, the probability that both independent expansions would fall inside a six-month pre-election window is roughly 0.125² ≈ 1.6%. With only two observations, this is not a formal statistical test, and institutional constraints—such as sunset dates and the budget cycle—also restrict when tax credit legislation can move. Nevertheless, the fact that both expansions were enacted in gubernatorial election years and within a few months of Election Day is unlikely to be purely accidental.

The 2014 expansion fits a standard re-election story: Brown was actively campaigning for a fourth term and could prominently advertise AB 1839 as a "job creator" and an effort to fight "runaway production" and protect middle-class union jobs. The 2018 expansion illustrates a broader party-level electoral logic. Although Brown was term-limited and not on the ballot, his administration and legislative allies still had incentives to deliver visible employment-oriented policy victories ahead of an open-seat gubernatorial contest and to shore up relationships with studios and entertainment unions that are central to the state's governing coalition. Taken together, the timing evidence suggests that California's film tax credits function not only as economic-development tools but also as politically salient instruments that tend to be expanded in the run-up to high-salience statewide elections, which helps explain why the modest employment and wage effects documented above may still be electorally attractive.

## Summary and Interpretation

### Main Findings

1. **Employment Effects (SCM - Preferred Method):**
   - Program 2.0 (2015): +3.5% employment increase (p = 0.29, **not statistically significant**)
   - Program 3.0 (2020): +4.3% employment increase (p = 0.14, **not statistically significant**)
   - **Neither effect achieves statistical significance (p > 0.05), meaning we cannot confidently conclude there was employment growth.** The positive point estimates are suggestive but not conclusive.

2. **Wage Effects (DiD):**
   - Program 2.0 (2015): +9.1% wage increase (**p = 0.003, significant**)
   - Program 3.0 (2020): -6.9% wage decrease (p = 0.15)

3. **Migration Patterns (ACS):**
   - Persistent net inflow of film workers throughout 2009-2023 (average +2,029 workers annually)
   - Consistent net in-migration across both pre-treatment and post-treatment periods
   - 2021 showed smallest net inflow (+58 workers) following Program 3.0, but returned to typical levels in 2022-2023

4. **Political Timing (Electoral Cycle):**
   - Both major expansions enacted in gubernatorial election years
   - Program 2.0: Signed 1.5 months before November 2014 election (Brown re-election)
   - Program 3.0: Signed 4.5 months before November 2018 election (Newsom elected, Brown term-limited)
   - Probability of both expansions falling in 6-month pre-election window by chance: ~1.6%

5. **Methodological Validity:**
   - DiD suffers from parallel trends violations and placebo test failures, suggesting estimates are biased by pre-existing trends
   - SCM provides more credible causal inference, with California ranking among the top 2 states in placebo tests

### Integrated Interpretation

The evidence from four complementary analyses—SCM employment effects, DiD wage effects, ACS migration patterns, and political timing—paints a nuanced picture of California's film tax credit programs.

**Employment Effects and Migration Patterns:**

The SCM results show positive point estimates for employment (3-4% increases), but **neither effect is statistically significant (p = 0.29 and p = 0.14), meaning we cannot confidently conclude there was employment growth.** The ACS migration data reveals persistent net inflow of film workers throughout the study period, with California consistently gaining workers from other states. This pattern suggests that California has been attracting film industry workers throughout the study period, which could be consistent with the positive (though not statistically significant) employment point estimates. However, the migration inflows were not meaningfully larger following the tax credit expansions—net inflow actually decreased in 2020-2021 relative to pre-treatment years—suggesting the tax credits did not substantially enhance California's ability to attract workers. The substantial wage premium (9.1% for 2015, p = 0.003) is the only statistically significant finding, suggesting that existing workers may have received higher compensation even in the absence of detectable employment growth.

**Political Context for Null Employment Effects:**

The political timing analysis provides crucial context for interpreting the lack of statistically significant employment effects. Both major expansions were enacted in gubernatorial election years and within months of Election Day, suggesting that electoral incentives may drive program expansion even in the absence of demonstrable economic performance. The 2014 expansion fits a standard re-election story (Brown campaigning), while the 2018 expansion illustrates broader party-level electoral logic (Brown term-limited but party delivering visible policy victories). The fact that programs with no statistically significant employment effects can still be electorally attractive when timed around high-salience elections helps explain why film tax credits persist despite the lack of evidence for meaningful employment growth.

**Overall Assessment:**

Taken together, the evidence suggests that **California's film tax credit programs did not generate statistically significant employment growth.** The SCM employment effects (3-4% point estimates) are not statistically significant (p = 0.29 and p = 0.14), meaning we cannot confidently conclude the programs increased employment. The only statistically significant finding is the wage premium (9.1% for 2015, p = 0.003), suggesting existing workers received higher compensation, but this occurred in the absence of detectable employment growth. The ACS migration data shows persistent net inflow of film workers throughout the study period, indicating California has been consistently attracting workers from other states. However, net inflow did not meaningfully increase following the tax credit expansions—in fact, it decreased in 2020-2021 relative to pre-treatment years—suggesting the tax credits did not substantially enhance California's ability to attract workers beyond the baseline inflow pattern. The political timing evidence—both expansions enacted in election years within months of Election Day—suggests these programs function primarily as signaling devices for electoral credit-claiming rather than engines of genuine economic development, which helps explain why programs with no statistically significant employment effects may still be politically sustainable.

### Next Steps

Future analysis should:
1. Expand donor pool if possible to improve statistical power
2. Obtain program expenditure data for cost-per-job calculations
3. Explore heterogeneous effects by occupation or production type
4. Analyze temporary vs. permanent migration patterns using alternative data sources
