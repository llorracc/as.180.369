## Data Summary

The panel dataset consists of quarterly observations for three states (California, New York, Georgia) over 64 quarters (2010 Q1 to 2025 Q1), totaling 192 state-quarter observations. California is the treated unit; New York and Georgia serve as controls based on industry scale and policy stability.

**Table 1: Summary Statistics by State (2010-2025)**

| State | Employment (Mean) | Avg Weekly Wage (Mean) | GDP Growth (%) | Unemployment (%) |
|-------|-------------------|------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| California | 109,656 | 2,338 | 3.12 | 7.16 |
| New York | 43,307 | 2,094 | 1.86 | 6.12 |
| Georgia | 10,158 | 1,323 | 2.85 | 5.90 |

## Difference-in-Differences Results

**Table 2: DiD Regression Results**

| Outcome | Treatment | Coefficient | P-value | % Change | Significant? |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------|----------|--------------|
| Employment | Program 2.0 (2015) | -0.202 | 0.316 | -18.3% | No |
| Employment | Program 3.0 (2020) | -0.036 | 0.526 | -3.5% | No |
| Wages | Program 2.0 (2015) | +0.087 | **0.003** | +9.1% | **Yes** |
| Wages | Program 3.0 (2020) | -0.072 | 0.153 | -6.9% | No |

**Key Findings:** No statistically significant employment effects were detected for either program. The only significant finding is a 9.1% wage premium following Program 2.0 (p = 0.003).

### DiD Limitations

DiD estimates are unreliable due to parallel trends violations:
- California vs. Georgia: 0.153 log points/year difference (substantial violation)
- Placebo test (2013 Q2): coefficient = -0.300, p = 0.005 (spurious effect)

![Parallel Trends](images/did_parallel_trends.png)

**Conclusion:** DiD employment estimates are biased by pre-existing trends and should not be interpreted causally.

## Synthetic Control Method Results

Given DiD limitations, SCM provides more credible causal inference by optimally weighting donor states based on pre-treatment fit.

**Optimal Weights:** New York receives 100% weight for both treatments, reflecting its superior match to California's industry trajectory.

**Table 3: SCM Results**

| Treatment | Effect (%) | P-value | CA Rank | Significant? |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| Program 2.0 (2015) | +3.5% | 0.286 | 2nd/7 | No |
| Program 3.0 (2020) | +4.3% | 0.143 | 1st/7 | No |

**Key Finding:** No statistically significant employment effects were detected. While point estimates are positive (3-4%), p-values exceed 0.05, meaning we cannot conclude the programs increased employment.

### Placebo Tests

Permutation-based inference shows California ranks among top states in post-treatment deviation, but neither effect achieves statistical significance (p = 0.286 and p = 0.143).

## ACS Migration Analysis

To test whether employment patterns reflect genuine worker relocation, I analyze IPUMS ACS migration data (2009-2023) for film industry workers.

**Table 4: California Film Industry Net Migration (Selected Years)**

| Year | Net Migration | Migration Rate | Notes |
|------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| 2013 | +5,496 | +2.97% | Largest inflow |
| **2015** | +2,058 | +1.08% | Program 2.0 |
| **2020** | +1,667 | +0.74% | Program 3.0 |
| **2021** | +58 | +0.03% | Smallest inflow |
| Average | +2,029 | +1.03% | Persistent inflow |

![Migration](images/california_film_migration.png)

**Key Finding:** California experienced persistent net inflow throughout 2009-2023 (average +2,029 workers/year). However, net inflow did not increase following tax credit expansions—it actually declined in 2020-2021. The tax credits did not enhance California's baseline ability to attract workers.

## Political Timing Analysis

**Table 5: Political Timing of Expansions**

| Program | Enactment | Election | Months Before | Election Year? |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| 2.0 | Sep 18, 2014 | Nov 4, 2014 | 1.5 | Yes (Brown re-election) |
| 3.0 | Jun 27, 2018 | Nov 6, 2018 | 4.5 | Yes (Newsom elected) |

Both expansions were enacted in gubernatorial election years within months of Election Day. If timing were random, probability of both falling in a 6-month pre-election window: ~1.6%.

## Summary

| Analysis | Finding | Significant? |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| SCM Employment (2015) | +3.5% | No (p = 0.29) |
| SCM Employment (2020) | +4.3% | No (p = 0.14) |
| DiD Wages (2015) | +9.1% | **Yes (p = 0.003)** |
| ACS Migration | No post-policy increase | N/A |
| Political Timing | Both in election years | N/A |

**Overall:** No statistically significant employment effects were detected. The only significant finding is the 9.1% wage premium (2015). Migration data shows persistent net inflow that did not strengthen after tax credit expansions. Political timing suggests electoral rather than economic motivations.
