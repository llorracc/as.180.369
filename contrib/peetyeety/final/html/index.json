Second, even in states often portrayed as “winners” in the incentive race, evidence of lasting cluster formation is limited and sensitive to modeling choices (Button 2021; Owens & Rennhoff 2018; Workman 2021). Third, the diffusion and persistence of film incentives appear to be driven as much by political incentives and policy emulation as by rigorous assessments of economic performance (Adkisson 2013; Thom 2019; Owens & Rennhoff 2023; Christopherson & Rightor 2010).","position":{"start":{"line":57,"column":1},"end":{"line":57,"column":1}},"key":"QYeoYPvD5P"}],"key":"HGGa8mKT6M"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":59,"column":1},"end":{"line":59,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Within this framework, my study makes three contributions.

Methodologically, I combine difference-in-differences and synthetic control methods with ACS-based migration flows and NAICS-precise QCEW data, directly addressing the measurement concerns raised by Rickman and Wang (2020, 2022) and the relocation vs. reclassification problem highlighted across the literature. Contextually, I embed these economic results in the political-economy framework developed by Adkisson (2013), Thom (2019), and Owens and Rennhoff (2023), evaluating whether California’s expansions are better understood as electoral and symbolic strategies than as responses to demonstrable economic success.","position":{"start":{"line":59,"column":1},"end":{"line":59,"column":1}},"key":"ZLugvHWiid"}],"key":"mHTySaPBq8"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":61,"column":1},"end":{"line":61,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"By integrating these perspectives, the paper situates California’s Film and Television Tax Credit within a mature empirical literature that is skeptical of large targeted incentives as engines of development.
