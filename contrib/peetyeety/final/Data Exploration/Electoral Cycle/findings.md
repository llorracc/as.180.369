### Political Timing and Gubernatorial Election Cycles

To contextualize the economic results, I examine whether California’s major film tax credit expansions were timed around gubernatorial elections. I focus on gubernatorial (rather than legislative) cycles because governors must sign any tax credit legislation, routinely campaign on “jobs” and economic development, and are the focal actors in highly visible statewide contests. The gubernatorial calendar is also clean and regular (every four years), which makes it a natural benchmark for studying election-cycle timing.

Table X summarizes the timing of the two expansions studied in this paper. Program 2.0 was authorized by AB 1839, which Governor Jerry Brown signed on September 18, 2014, less than two months before the November 4, 2014 gubernatorial election. Program 3.0 was adopted through 2018 budget trailer legislation (including SB 871 and related bills) and signed on June 27, 2018, roughly four and a half months before the November 6, 2018 gubernatorial election. In both cases, the legislature and governor finalized substantial expansions of the film tax credit within a narrow pre-election window.

**Table X. Political Timing of California Film Tax Credit Expansions**

| Program        | Key bill(s) / vehicle                              | Enactment date      | Gubernatorial election        | Months before election (approx.) | Election year? | Governor on ballot? |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Program 2.0    | AB 1839 (California Film & Television Job Retention and Promotion Act) | 18 Sep 2014         | 4 Nov 2014 (Brown vs. Kashkari) | ≈ 1.5 months                   | Yes            | Yes                  |
| Program 3.0    | SB 871 (extension/expansion via budget trailer)    | 27 Jun 2018         | 6 Nov 2018 (Newsom vs. Cox)     | ≈ 4.5 months                   | Yes            | No (Brown term-limited) |

A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation highlights how concentrated this timing is. California elects its governor every four years, so a six-month pre-election window represents only 12.5% of the cycle. If the timing of major program expansions were unrelated to elections, the probability that both independent expansions would fall inside a six-month pre-election window is roughly \(0.125^2 \approx 1.6\%\). With only two observations, this is not a formal statistical test, and institutional constraints—such as sunset dates and the budget cycle—also restrict when tax credit legislation can move. Nevertheless, the fact that both expansions were enacted in gubernatorial election years and within a few months of Election Day is unlikely to be purely accidental.

The 2014 expansion fits a standard re-election story: Brown was actively campaigning for a fourth term and could prominently advertise AB 1839 as a “job creator” and an effort to fight “runaway production” and protect middle-class union jobs. The 2018 expansion illustrates a broader party-level electoral logic. Although Brown was term-limited and not on the ballot, his administration and legislative allies still had incentives to deliver visible employment-oriented policy victories ahead of an open-seat gubernatorial contest and to shore up relationships with studios and entertainment unions that are central to the state’s governing coalition. Taken together, the timing evidence suggests that California’s film tax credits function not only as economic-development tools but also as politically salient instruments that tend to be expanded in the run-up to high-salience statewide elections, which helps explain why the modest employment and wage effects documented above may still be electorally attractive.
