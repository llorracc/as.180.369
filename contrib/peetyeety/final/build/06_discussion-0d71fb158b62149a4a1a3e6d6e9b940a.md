## Interpretation in Context of Existing Literature

The findings from this study contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting that film tax credits produce modest, context-dependent effects that fall short of the transformative impacts often promised by policymakers. The SCM results show positive point estimates for employment (3-4% increases), but neither effect achieves statistical significance (p = 0.29 and p = 0.14, both > 0.05), meaning we cannot confidently conclude there was employment growth. While the point estimates are consistent with Thom's (2018) finding that transferable credits modestly increase employment over time, the lack of statistical significance in this study suggests that even California's large-scale, modernized programs—implemented during the streaming content boom—do not produce detectable employment effects.

The substantial wage premium (9.1% for 2015) identified through DiD analysis represents a notable finding that distinguishes California's experience from earlier studies. While Thom found that refundable credits temporarily raise wages, the persistent wage effect observed here suggests that California's transferable credit structure may have generated sustained improvements in worker compensation. However, this finding must be interpreted cautiously given the parallel trends violations in the DiD framework and the lack of a corresponding wage effect for the 2020 expansion.

The migration evidence provides important context for interpreting the employment results. The ACS data reveals persistent net inflow of film workers throughout the study period, with California consistently gaining workers from other states. However, this baseline inflow pattern did not meaningfully increase following the tax credit expansions—net inflow actually decreased in 2020-2021 relative to pre-treatment years. Combined with the lack of statistically significant employment effects in SCM, this suggests that while California has been attracting film industry workers, the tax credits did not substantially enhance this baseline attraction. The migration data demonstrates the value of supplementing administrative employment data with migration evidence to provide a more complete picture of worker flows.

## Methodological Contributions and Limitations

The comparison between DiD and SCM results highlights the importance of method selection in policy evaluation. The DiD framework, while standard in the literature, produced estimates that were confounded by pre-existing differential trends between California and Georgia. The parallel trends violation and placebo test failure suggest that DiD estimates may reflect underlying state-specific growth patterns rather than causal policy impacts. The SCM approach, by optimally weighting donor states based on pre-treatment fit, provides a more credible counterfactual and yields positive point estimates for employment, though these effects are not statistically significant (p = 0.29 and p = 0.14).

However, the SCM analysis faces its own limitations. The small donor pool (n = 6 states) constrains statistical power, making it difficult to achieve conventional significance thresholds. The permutation-based inference approach, while appropriate for the single-treated-unit case, requires California to rank first among all states to achieve p < 0.10, which occurred for the 2020 treatment but not for 2015. The optimal weighting algorithm assigning 100% weight to New York suggests that California's film industry trajectory is most similar to New York's, but this also limits the diversity of the counterfactual.

The ACS migration analysis addresses a key methodological concern but introduces its own measurement challenges. The distinction between temporary and permanent migration is particularly relevant for project-based industries like film production, where workers may relocate temporarily for specific productions without changing their permanent residence. The ACS data captures permanent state-to-state moves but may miss these temporary relocations, potentially understating the policy's impact on production activity while accurately reflecting its limited effect on permanent worker relocation.

## Policy Implications

The integrated findings suggest that California's film tax credits did not generate statistically significant employment growth. While the SCM point estimates suggest modest employment increases (3-4%), these effects are not statistically significant, meaning we cannot confidently conclude the programs increased employment. The substantial wage premium (9.1% for 2015, p = 0.003) is the only statistically significant finding, indicating that the policy improved compensation for existing California film workers, potentially slowing the state's competitive decline relative to other production hubs. The 2021 migration data showing the smallest net inflow (+58 workers, +0.028%) following the 2020 expansion suggests that the policy did not enhance California's baseline ability to attract workers, though net inflow returned to more typical levels in 2022-2023.

However, while California has been consistently gaining film industry workers through net inflow throughout the study period, the tax credits did not meaningfully enhance this baseline attraction. Net inflow actually decreased in 2020-2021 relative to pre-treatment years, suggesting the programs did not substantially improve California's ability to attract workers beyond the existing pattern. This finding aligns with Bradbury's (2020) conclusion that film incentives show no significant effect on aggregate state economic outcomes, as the sectoral gains observed here likely represent reallocation rather than net job creation.

The policy's apparent success in improving worker compensation, combined with its failure to enhance the baseline net inflow pattern, suggests that California's tax credits may have functioned more as a defensive policy—maintaining existing advantages—than as an offensive strategy to substantially expand production. This interpretation is consistent with Owens and Rennhoff's (2024) finding that film tax credits persist for political rather than economic reasons, as the visible benefits to existing workers may provide sufficient political justification even if the policy fails to achieve its broader economic development goals.

## Comparison with Other States

The findings also provide context for understanding why other states' film tax credit programs have shown varying levels of success. Georgia's rapid growth following its 2008 program initiation, which made it the most successful state-level program outside California, suggests that early-mover advantages and aggressive incentive structures may produce stronger effects than later programs implemented in a more competitive environment. California's entry into the incentive landscape came relatively late, after many competing states had already established their programs, potentially limiting the policy's ability to attract new production.

While California has been consistently gaining film industry workers through net inflow, the tax credits did not meaningfully enhance this baseline pattern. This suggests that factors beyond tax incentives—such as production infrastructure, talent pools, and cost structures—continue to be the primary drivers of location decisions. The tax credits may have helped maintain California's competitive position but were insufficient to substantially expand the state's ability to attract production beyond the existing baseline inflow.

## Limitations and Future Research

Several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the statistical power constraints in the SCM analysis limit the ability to draw definitive conclusions about policy effectiveness. Second, the lack of program expenditure data prevents cost-effectiveness analysis, which would be crucial for policy evaluation. Third, the analysis focuses on aggregate industry-level effects and does not explore heterogeneous impacts across different types of productions, occupations, or regions within California.

Future research should address these gaps by expanding the donor pool if possible, obtaining detailed program expenditure data for cost-per-job calculations, and exploring heterogeneous effects by production type or occupation. Additionally, alternative data sources that capture temporary migration patterns could provide a more complete picture of the policy's impact on production activity, distinguishing between permanent worker relocation and temporary project-based employment.

## Conclusion

The evidence from this study suggests that California's film tax credit programs did not generate statistically significant employment growth. While SCM point estimates suggest modest employment increases (3-4%), neither effect achieves statistical significance (p = 0.29 and p = 0.14), meaning we cannot confidently conclude the programs increased employment. The substantial wage premium (9.1% for 2015) is the only statistically significant finding, suggesting improved compensation for existing workers, but this occurred in the absence of detectable employment growth. The ACS migration data shows that California has been consistently gaining film industry workers through net inflow, but the tax credits did not meaningfully enhance this baseline pattern—net inflow actually decreased in 2020-2021 relative to pre-treatment years. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of film tax credit effectiveness and highlight the importance of using multiple data sources and identification strategies to evaluate place-based economic development policies.
