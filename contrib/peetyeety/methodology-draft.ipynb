        "# Methodology Draft: California Film Tax Credit Employment Effects\n",
        "\n",
        "## Research Question and Hypotheses\n",
        "\n",
        "**Primary Research Question**: Did California's film tax credit expansions in 2015 (AB 1839) and 2020 (AB 2021) generate sustained employment and wage gains in the motion picture industry, or do observed effects reflect statistical artifacts of firm reclassification?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hypotheses**:\n",
        "\n",
        "**H1 (Employment Effect)**: California's 2015 tax credit expansion increased motion picture industry employment relative to control states that did not expand programs during this period.\n",
        "\n",
        "**H2 (Wage Effect)**: The tax credit expansion increased average wages in California's motion picture industry, potentially through labor demand effects or skill composition changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**H3 (Migration Validation)**: If H1 is supported by QCEW data, we should observe corresponding increases in migration of film workers to California in ACS data. Divergence between QCEW employment gains and ACS migration patterns would suggest reclassification rather than genuine job creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**H4 (Political Timing)**: Tax credit expansions align with electoral cycles, suggesting political motivations may influence program design independent of economic evidence.\n",

        "## Overview of Empirical Strategy\n",

        "3. **Validation Analysis**: American Community Survey migration data to distinguish genuine job creation from statistical reclassification\n",
        "4. **Descriptive Supplement**: Political timing analysis examining expansion dates relative to electoral cycles\n",

        "### 4.1 Rationale\n",
        "\n",
        "Following Rickman & Wang (2020), I implement synthetic control as a robustness check on DiD estimates. Synthetic control addresses two concerns:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Control group selection**: Rather than choosing control states arbitrarily, synthetic control constructs an optimal weighted combination of donor states that best matches California's pre-treatment characteristics\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Parallel trends**: Synthetic control explicitly matches pre-treatment trends, addressing the key DiD assumption\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.2 Method Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "**Synthetic California Construction**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Donor pool**: States without major film incentive changes 2015-2022\n",
        "   - Exclude: Georgia, Louisiana, New Mexico (major program changes)\n",
        "   - Include: New York, Texas, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Matching variables** (2009 Q1 - 2015 Q1):\n",
        "   - Quarterly employment in motion picture industry\n",
        "   - Average wages\n",
        "   - State unemployment rate\n",
        "   - State GSP growth\n",
        "   - Number of establishments\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Optimization**: Find weights $w_1, w_2, ..., w_J$ that minimize:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\sum_{t=1}^{T_0} (Y_{CA,t} - \\sum_{j=1}^J w_j Y_{j,t})^2$$\n",
        "   \n",
        "Where $T_0$ = pre-treatment period, $j$ indexes donor states\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "$$\\hat{\\tau}_t = Y_{CA,t} - \\sum_{j=1}^J w_j Y_{j,t}$$\n",
        "   \n",
        "For $t > T_0$ (post-treatment period)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.3 Statistical Inference\n",
        "\n",
        "**Permutation Test (Placebo)**:\n",
        "- Apply synthetic control to each donor state (pretend each was treated)\n",
        "- Compare California's post-treatment gap to distribution of placebo gaps\n",

        "\n",
        "**Owens & Rennhoff (2024) Finding**: Film tax credits are driven by **political incentives** rather than economic evidence\n",
        "- Legislators vote based on party, gubernatorial alignment, and electoral competitiveness\n",
        "- Local industry presence and lobbying do NOT predict votes\n",

        "**Theory**: Politicians time visible policy actions around elections to maximize credit-claiming\n",

        "**Predicted Patterns**:\n",
        "1. **Pre-election expansions**: New programs or expansions in years before elections\n",

        "   - Media coverage and ribbon-cutting opportunities\n",

        "**Preliminary Assessment**: \n",
        "- Timing does NOT follow simple pre-election pattern\n",
        "- May reflect other political factors:\n",
        "  - Legislative session timing (budget cycle)\n",
        "  - Industry lobbying pressure\n",

        "**Scenario 4: Weak/Null Employment Effects + No Electoral Timing**\n",
        "→ Inertia or institutional factors (once established, programs continue automatically)\n",

        "**Expected Result**: Based on Owens & Rennhoff (2024), likely Scenario 3 or 4\n",
        "- Political incentives explain persistence regardless of effectiveness\n",
        "- Electoral timing may be less important than legislative logrolling, party discipline, and interest group pressure\n",
