    "1. **Modest effects persist even at large scale**\n",
    "   - $1.55B program produces similar effects to smaller programs\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Benefits accrue to existing workers**\n",
    "   - Wage premiums and retention improvements\n",
    "   - But limited net job creation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tax credits may be insufficient alone**\n",
    "   - Other factors (infrastructure, talent, costs) continue to drive location decisions\n",
    "   - Cannot fundamentally alter competitive position\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cost-effectiveness questions remain**\n",
    "   - Need expenditure data to evaluate whether benefits justify costs\n",
