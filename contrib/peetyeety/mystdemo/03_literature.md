# Literature Review

![Literature Map](images/litmaps.png)

The academic literature on state film tax incentives has expanded rapidly over the past decade and reaches a surprisingly consistent conclusion: despite large fiscal costs, these programs generate at best modest and often transitory gains in measured film activity, with limited evidence of broader economic development. My study builds on three strands of this literature—early creative-economy critiques, national and state-level quasi-experimental evaluations, and emerging work on industry aggregation and political incentives—while also incorporating recent advances in empirical methods and research tools.

## 1. Creative-Economy Narratives and Early Policy Critiques

Early work framed film incentives as part of a broader “creative economy” development strategy. Christopherson and Rightor (2010) show how states treated film and television production as emblematic of a high-skill, high-visibility sector, using subsidies to signal competitiveness and cultural vibrancy rather than to correct identifiable market failures. They argue that this “big business of the creative economy” narrative encouraged states to compete for mobile productions even when underlying jobs were temporary, highly mobile, and prone to leakage out of the local economy.

Adkisson (2013) situates film incentives within a policy-diffusion and convergence framework. Using a case study of film-production employment from 1997–2011, he documents how states rapidly converged on similar incentive regimes despite weak evidence of net employment gains. His analysis highlights the role of emulation, competitive “bandwagons,” and interest-group pressure in sustaining film incentives, suggesting that policy persistence may be driven more by political and symbolic returns than by measurable economic outcomes. This political-economy perspective motivates my focus on California’s timing of major credit expansions around gubernatorial elections.

Together, these early contributions frame film incentives as a politically attractive but economically fragile development strategy. They also underscore a key challenge that my study confronts directly: distinguishing genuine growth in film employment from reclassification, displacement, or zero-sum relocation across jurisdictions.

## 2. National Evidence on Economic and Labor-Market Effects

The modern empirical literature evaluates whether film incentives meaningfully expand film employment, wages, or output at the state level. Thom (2018) provides the most comprehensive national panel analysis to date, examining state motion-picture employment, wages, gross state product, and industry share from the late 1980s through 2013. Across multiple specifications, he finds at most modest and non-robust wage gains and essentially no effect on employment, output, or market share, concluding that film incentives are a poor engine for broad-based development.

A complementary line of work adopts more targeted identification strategies. Swenson (2017) uses Economic Development Quarterly’s typical quasi-experimental framework to study incentive adoption and film production, finding that incentives generate some increase in reported production but little evidence of durable local industry growth. Thom (2019) broadens the lens beyond film to examine state corporate tax incentives for the entertainment sector more generally, using quasi-experimental methods to assess job creation. He finds that these incentives rarely produce sustained employment gains, reinforcing the notion that targeted credits tend to reshuffle rather than expand economic activity.

Button (2019) advances the literature by combining panel methods with more precise incentive measures. Using data on the presence, generosity, and structure of state film incentives, he shows that while incentives can shift some production toward subsidizing states, they have no meaningful effect on overall film employment, wages, or establishments at the state level. Bradbury (2020) reaches a similar conclusion, estimating that average returns per dollar of subsidy are far below unity and in many cases negative once opportunity costs are considered.

Owens and Rennhoff (2018) focus specifically on location decisions using a discrete-choice framework. Modeling where films choose to shoot as a function of incentives and location characteristics, they show that tax incentives do affect the probability a production locates in a given state, but that these gains are highly concentrated and do **not** translate into the emergence of a permanent, self-sustaining film cluster in most adopting states. Their findings underscore the difference between transient production days and durable agglomeration—an issue that is central to my focus on NAICS 512110 employment and on potential relocation from donor states to California.

Taken together, this national literature suggests that film tax incentives can redirect some production activity but do not reliably generate large, lasting gains in employment or wages. My study extends this work temporally (through 2022), focuses specifically on the motion-picture production subsector (512110), and leverages donor states with long-standing incentive regimes (e.g., New York, Georgia, Louisiana) to test whether California’s recent expansions merely recapture displaced activity or generate net new employment.

## 3. State-Level Evidence, California, and Cluster Dynamics

A growing set of state-level studies explores how film incentives interact with pre-existing industry clusters. Thom (2018b) evaluates California’s original Film and Production Tax Credit (Program 1.0) from 1991–2016, using occupational employment data in three film-related categories. He finds no statistically significant effect of the credit on California film employment, and little evidence that competing incentives in other states materially altered California’s trajectory. The state’s film employment appears instead to track national trends, suggesting that the original program primarily subsidized activity that would have occurred anyway.

Workman (2021) revisits California with more recent data and a narrower outcome—film production counts—using quasi-experimental methods focused on the transition from Program 1.0 to Program 2.0. He finds some increase in filmed projects associated with the credit, but the magnitude is small relative to program costs and heavily concentrated in specific production types. Combined with Thom’s (2018b) null employment results, this suggests that California’s early programs may have altered the composition of local production without generating substantial new jobs.

Button (2021) examines whether state incentives can seed or grow a local film industry by studying Louisiana and New Mexico, two states often held up as success stories. Using a mix of panel and cluster-oriented approaches, he concludes that while incentives can temporarily boost production volume, evidence of lasting local industry development is limited and fragile. This is important for my study: if aggressive, sustained incentive regimes in smaller states only weakly reshaped their local film sectors, California’s much larger but more mature industry may be even less responsive at the margin.

Rickman and Wang (2022) address a central methodological issue in this literature: industry aggregation. They show that many impact studies rely on broad NAICS categories (e.g., 512 “Motion Picture and Sound Recording”) whose multipliers and dynamics differ sharply from the incentivized subsector (51211/512110). Their analysis of input–output multipliers across 48 states demonstrates that using overly aggregated sectors can materially distort estimated impacts. This directly motivates my decision to focus on NAICS 512110 in QCEW rather than broader entertainment categories, and to interpret multiplier-based impact claims with caution.

Finally, Rickman and Wang’s (2020) review of the “nascent literature” on state film incentives catalogues these empirical studies and emphasizes two unresolved challenges: separating relocation from reclassification in administrative data, and linking micro-level production decisions to macro-level labor-market outcomes. My research responds to both by pairing QCEW data with ACS interstate migration flows to identify whether measured employment gains in California coincide with net inflows of film workers from incentive-intensive donor states.

## 4. Political Incentives and the Persistence of Film Tax Credits

The persistence and expansion of film incentives despite weak economic evidence has spurred a parallel literature on political behavior and incentive design. Adkisson’s (2013) discussion of policy convergence already points to emulation, elite networking, and rent-seeking as drivers of widespread adoption. Thom (2019) extends this logic, showing that state corporate tax incentives for the entertainment industry often survive in the absence of clear job-creation effects, implying that policymakers may prioritize visible project announcements and industry goodwill over long-run fiscal efficiency.

Owens and Rennhoff (2023) shift attention to the political side of tax-incentive design more broadly. Using data on state tax incentives and legislative voting, they find that support for such incentives is strongly correlated with the geographic distribution of potential benefits and with partisan and institutional characteristics, even when economic evidence is weak. While their setting is not limited to film incentives, their findings help explain why California continued to expand its program—most notably in 2014 and 2018 (with major allocation increases beginning in 2015 and 2020)—despite accumulating research questioning the returns to large-scale film subsidies.

In my study, I build on this political-economy literature by examining whether California’s major program expansions align more closely with electoral cycles and lobbying pressures than with demonstrable improvements in employment or wage outcomes. By combining administrative labor data, interstate migration flows, and policy timing, I can assess whether expansions occurred in response to objective economic underperformance or as part of a broader political strategy.

## 5. Data, Methods, and Research Tools

The film-incentive literature has also evolved methodologically. Many of the studies above—Thom (2018, 2018b, 2019), Swenson (2017), Button (2019, 2021), Bradbury (2020), Workman (2021), and Owens and Rennhoff (2018)—use panel data models, difference-in-differences designs, and, in some cases, synthetic control–style comparisons to approximate causal effects. Rickman and Wang (2022) highlight the importance of careful industry classification and multiplier construction for credible inference.

My empirical strategy draws directly from these methodological advances. I implement stacked difference-in-differences models using QCEW NAICS 512110 data to estimate how California’s employment and wages evolve relative to donor states with long-running incentive regimes, and I use synthetic control methods to form data-driven counterfactuals for California’s film cluster. I then augment these approaches with ACS-based migration measures to address the key concern raised by Rickman and Wang (2020, 2022): whether observed changes in administrative employment reflect real worker inflows or simply reclassification.

Korinek (2023) adds a complementary dimension by highlighting how generative AI can support economic research via automated data cleaning, document parsing, reproducible pipelines, and code generation. While his focus is not film incentives specifically, the study provides a conceptual framework for integrating large language models into empirical workflows. I follow this emerging practice by using AI-assisted tools for literature discovery, data documentation, and code review, while retaining conventional econometric methods for identification and estimation. This aligns my research with both the substantive film-incentive literature and the frontier of empirical practice.

## 6. Synthesis and Remaining Gaps

Across these strands, the literature reaches three broad conclusions. First, despite their popularity and fiscal scale, state film incentives rarely generate large, durable gains in film employment or wages, and often fail to produce positive net returns once opportunity costs are considered (Thom 2018; Button 2019; Bradbury 2020; Swenson 2017). Second, even in states often portrayed as “winners” in the incentive race, evidence of lasting cluster formation is limited and sensitive to modeling choices (Button 2021; Owens & Rennhoff 2018; Workman 2021). Third, the diffusion and persistence of film incentives appear to be driven as much by political incentives and policy emulation as by rigorous assessments of economic performance (Adkisson 2013; Thom 2019; Owens & Rennhoff 2023; Christopherson & Rightor 2010).

Within this framework, my study makes three contributions. Temporally, I extend the analysis through 2025 for QCEW and 2023 for ACS and focus on California's major 2015 and 2020 program expansions, allowing me to test whether larger, modernized credits perform differently than earlier, smaller programs in both California and other states. Methodologically, I combine difference-in-differences and synthetic control methods with ACS-based migration flows and NAICS-precise QCEW data, directly addressing the measurement concerns raised by Rickman and Wang (2020, 2022) and the relocation vs. reclassification problem highlighted across the literature. Contextually, I embed these economic results in the political-economy framework developed by Adkisson (2013), Thom (2019), and Owens and Rennhoff (2023), evaluating whether California’s expansions are better understood as electoral and symbolic strategies than as responses to demonstrable economic success.

By integrating these perspectives, the paper situates California’s Film and Television Tax Credit within a mature empirical literature that is skeptical of large targeted incentives as engines of development. The question is no longer whether film incentives “work” in a broad sense, but whether California’s scaled-up programs—implemented in an era of streaming, digital distribution, and renewed competition from other hubs—can meaningfully alter the trajectory of an already dominant cluster, or whether they primarily redistribute existing activity and serve political objectives.
