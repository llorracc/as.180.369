# Reflections on Korinek's AI Productivity for Economists

After reading Korinek's paper on AI productivity for economists, I found several of his ideas both interesting and relatable. His work demonstrates how AI agents—autonomous systems based on large language models—are transforming the landscape of economic research by automating complex, multi-step tasks that traditionally consumed substantial researcher time and cognitive resources.

## Human Shift from Generators to Evaluators

One key insight that resonated with me is the notion that humans are shifting from generators to evaluators. Since ChatGPT's emergence in late 2022, I've been gradually trained to assess its performance when reviewing its output for my own use. This evaluative skill seems to be acquired primarily through hands-on usage, which suggests that to excel in today's environment, everyone needs substantial exposure to AI tools. As AI increasingly generates content, our primary role may become that of curators and assessors of quality rather than original creators. This shift is fundamental to understanding how research workflows will evolve—we must become adept at judging AI-generated literature reviews, econometric code, and data analyses rather than producing everything from scratch ourselves.

## Modularizing the Research Process

Korinek's breakdown of the research paper process into small, seemingly trivial pieces that collectively consume substantial time was particularly insightful. He identifies specific tasks like conducting literature reviews, writing and debugging code, fetching economic data, and coordinating complex workflows—each individually manageable but collectively overwhelming. By identifying these discrete cognitive tasks, we can leverage AI to replace significant cognitive power and time resources that researchers traditionally expend. This modularization allows us to see where AI can most effectively augment human capabilities, freeing researchers to focus on higher-level theoretical insights and creative problem-solving that truly requires human judgment.

## AI as Cognitive Partner

Perhaps most interestingly, I found value in Korinek's framing of AI as "brains" rather than just calculators. This perspective shift suggests treating AI tools as cognitive partners capable of reasoning and generation, rather than merely computational aids. Korinek demonstrates this through his discussion of agentic frameworks and what he calls "natural language programming," where economists can create sophisticated research assistants without traditional coding expertise. This distinction highlights the transformative potential of modern AI in academic work, suggesting we're entering an era where the boundary between human and machine cognition in research becomes increasingly collaborative rather than strictly divided.
