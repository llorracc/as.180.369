After reading the paper on AI productivity for Economists by Korinek, I thought some of his ideas were pretty interesting and relatable. I agree with the notion that humans are shifting from generators to evaluators. Ever since ChatGPT came out in late 2022, I've been indirectly trained to assess its performance when I want to use its output. I think this is a really a skill that is acquired through usage, which means to excel today everyone would need to have to some extent good exposure with AI. I also thought Korinek breaking down the research paper process into small, trivial importance, yet as a whole time-consuming pieces. With that, we could really leverage AI to replace a lot of the cognitive power and time resources researchers have. I think it's interesting to treat AI as brains, rather than just calculators.
