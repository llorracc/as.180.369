# Reflections on Korinek's AI Productivity for Economists

After reading Korinek's paper on AI productivity for economists, I found several of his ideas both interesting and relatable. 

## Human Shift from Generators to Evaluators

One key insight that resonated with me is the notion that humans are shifting from generators to evaluators. Since ChatGPT's emergence in late 2022, I've been gradually trained to assess its performance when reviewing its output for my own use. This evaluative skill seems to be acquired primarily through hands-on usage, which suggests that to excel in today's environment, everyone needs substantial exposure to AI tools. As AI increasingly generates content, our primary role may become that of curators and assessors of quality rather than original creators.

## Modularizing the Research Process

Korinek's breakdown of the research paper process into small, seemingly trivial pieces that collectively consume substantial time was particularly insightful. By identifying these discrete cognitive tasks, we can leverage AI to replace significant cognitive power and time resources that researchers traditionally expend. This modularization allows us to see where AI can most effectively augment human capabilities.

## AI as Cognitive Partner

Perhaps most interestingly, I found value in Korinek's framing of AI as "brains" rather than just calculators. This perspective shift suggests treating AI tools as cognitive partners capable of reasoning and generation, rather than merely computational aids. This distinction highlights the transformative potential of modern AI in academic work.
