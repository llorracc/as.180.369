    "The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) is a landmark environmental protection statute enacted in 1970. Adopted during the early period of the modern environmental movement, CEQA has served as a model for environmental review legislation in numerous states. The statute was designed to require the systematic assessment and public disclosure of the environmental impacts of proposed development projects, with the aim of mitigating adverse environmental externalities associated with construction activity. Although initially applicable primarily to public projects, subsequent judicial interpretations expanded CEQA’s scope to encompass the majority of private developments. At the core of the statute is the environmental review process, which conditions project approval on the completion of a detailed assessment of potential environmental impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "While CEQA has contributed to California’s leadership in environmental protection, it has also become increasingly implicated in one of the state’s most pressing economic challenges: housing affordability. California exhibits some of the highest housing costs and homelessness rates in the United States, reflecting a severe shortage of housing supply. CEQA’s extensive review requirements and the ability of third parties to challenge project approvals through litigation have led many policymakers and analysts to identify the statute as a contributor to delays and increased costs in housing production. In response to these concerns, California lawmakers enacted substantial rollbacks of CEQA in the summer of 2025 with bipartisan support. A statute originally signed into law by Republican Governor Ronald Reagan has thus come to be viewed across the political spectrum as a potential constraint on housing supply and broader economic performance. Given these recent reforms—and the possibility of further retrenchment—it is important to rigorously assess CEQA’s effects on housing prices, both for informing policy decisions in California and for guiding similar debates in other states considering environmental regulatory reform.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper proceeds in two stages. First, I examine the relationship between CEQA litigation intensity and housing prices in California using county-level variation in legal activity and housing market outcomes. Second, I analyze the effects of a prior episode of substantial CEQA reform—Senate Bill (SB) 743, enacted in 2013 and fully implemented in 2020—to provide evidence on the likely consequences of recent policy changes. Although the effects of the 2025 CEQA rollbacks cannot yet be directly observed, earlier reforms offer a useful empirical basis for assessing the potential housing market impacts of the current regulatory shift.
