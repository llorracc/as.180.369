    "This study examines the effects of CEQA litigation and a prior episode of CEQA reform on housing prices in California. The analysis proceeds in two parts. First, I estimate the relationship between CEQA litigation intensity and housing prices using a regression framework that combines publicly available data on CEQA litigation with housing price data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Second, I assess the effects of CEQA reform on housing prices by implementing a difference-in-differences design, exploiting variation across metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and over time, with housing price outcomes drawn from FHFA data and treatment status determined through hand-coded MSA classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Regression Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "This portion of the analysis draws on two primary data sources. The first is a comprehensive dataset of lawsuits filed under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) between 2019 and 2021, compiled by the Rose Foundation as part of a 2023 study. To my knowledge, this dataset represents the most complete publicly available record of CEQA litigation during this period. CEQA lawsuits are filed to challenge government-mandated environmental reviews associated with proposed development projects. I restrict the sample to lawsuits targeting residential housing projects, yielding a total of 109 housing-related CEQA lawsuits statewide over the three-year study period. While CEQA litigation involving non-housing projects may indirectly affect housing markets, analyzing such effects lies outside the scope of this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second data source is the Housing Price Index (HPI) published by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The FHFA HPI provides publicly available measures of housing price dynamics across the United States at multiple geographic levels. For the purposes of this analysis, I use annual, county-level HPI data for California, which allows for consistent measurement of housing price changes across local jurisdictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empirical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The empirical analysis begins with a linear regression framework that relates changes in housing prices to variation in CEQA litigation intensity at the county level. Specifically, I examine the relationship between the percentage change in the Housing Price Index (HPI) over selected time periods and a measure of CEQA litigation intensity constructed for each county. The CEQA litigation intensity index captures the number of residential housing units affected by CEQA litigation per 100,000 residents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The index is constructed by aggregating, for each county, the total number of housing units affected by CEQA-related lawsuits filed between 2019 and 2021. This total is then normalized by the county’s population, using 2018 Census population estimates, and scaled by 100,000 to facilitate comparability across counties of different sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{CEQA Litigation Intensity}\n",
    "=\n",
    "\\frac{\\text{Total housing units affected by CEQA litigation (2019--2021)}}{\\text{Population in 2018}}\n",
    "\\times 100{,}000\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After constructing the litigation intensity measure, I compute county-level percentage changes in the Housing Price Index (HPI) over two time horizons: 2015–2024 and 2019–2024. I then estimate the regression models separately for each period, allowing for an assessment of the relationship between CEQA litigation intensity and housing price growth over both a longer pre- and post-litigation horizon and a shorter, more recent window.\n",

    "## Difference-in-Differences \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview - SB 743\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of the CEQA reforms enacted in 2025, it is informative to examine the housing market effects of earlier regulatory changes to CEQA. Over the past decade, California has implemented a series of incremental reforms aimed at reconciling environmental review with the state’s climate and housing objectives. Among the most consequential of these reforms is Senate Bill (SB) 743, which became fully operative statewide in the third quarter of 2020. SB 743 fundamentally altered the evaluation of transportation impacts under CEQA by replacing traditional traffic congestion metrics—most notably Level of Service (LOS)—with Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT).\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the LOS framework, projects were evaluated based on their contribution to traffic congestion, a standard that tended to penalize dense, urban development and to favor lower-density, automobile-oriented projects, thereby reinforcing patterns of sprawl and road expansion. The shift to VMT reframed transportation analysis to focus on the extent to which projects increase automobile travel, aligning CEQA review more closely with greenhouse gas reduction and infill development goals. By reducing regulatory penalties associated with dense, transit-oriented development, the VMT standard is likely to have lowered barriers to urban infill and higher-density housing construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivated by this change in regulatory incentives, this study hypothesizes that the transition from LOS to VMT under SB 743 increased housing supply in affected jurisdictions, leading to a moderation in housing price growth following the reform’s implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference-in-differences analysis similarly relies on Housing Price Index (HPI) data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), but uses quarterly observations at the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) level. The sample includes twenty-three California MSAs observed from 2015 through 2025, allowing for the examination of housing price dynamics before and after the statewide implementation of SB 743 in 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each MSA is classified according to its pre-2020 exposure to Level of Service (LOS)–based transportation review. Treatment status is determined through a hand-coded (ChatGPT-assisted) classification based on publicly available data on traffic congestion and transportation conditions within each MSA prior to the reform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empirical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the hypothesis that the transition from LOS to VMT under SB 743 led to a deceleration in housing price growth, I implement a difference-in-differences research design. The analysis uses quarterly Housing Price Index (HPI) data for twenty-three California metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). Each MSA is classified based on its exposure to LOS-based transportation review prior to 2020, capturing the extent to which local development was constrained by congestion-based impact standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "MSAs with greater pre-reform LOS exposure are expected to experience larger changes in regulatory constraints following the adoption of the VMT standard and therefore serve as the treated group in the analysis. In contrast, MSAs with lower LOS exposure provide a control group. Under the identifying assumption of parallel pre-treatment trends, differential changes in housing price growth following the 2020 reform can be attributed to the transition from LOS to VMT.\n",
