    "This paper contributes to the growing literature on environmental regulation and housing markets by examining the relationship between the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and housing prices through two complementary empirical approaches. The existing literature documents substantial demand-side capitalization of environmental quality into housing prices, while work in urban economics emphasizes the role of regulatory constraints in limiting housing supply and amplifying price growth. Despite CEQA’s central role in California’s land-use regime, prior research on its housing market effects has been dominated by legal and policy analyses rather than causal economic evidence. This study seeks to bridge that gap by focusing on litigation intensity and a major regulatory reform—Senate Bill 743—within a framework informed by the broader economics literature on supply constraints, regulatory frictions, and spatial equilibrium.\n",

    "Using county-level variation in CEQA litigation intensity and housing price growth, the descriptive regression analysis finds little evidence of a systematic relationship between litigation activity and long-run or recent housing price appreciation. These results suggest that, at the county level, variation in CEQA litigation affecting housing projects is not strongly correlated with subsequent housing price growth. To assess the effects of regulatory reform more directly, the paper then exploits the statewide transition from Level of Service to Vehicle Miles Traveled under SB 743 using a difference-in-differences design at the metropolitan level. While point estimates indicate a modest post-reform reduction in housing price growth in MSAs with greater exposure to LOS-based review, the estimated effects are imprecise and not statistically distinguishable from zero. Event-study evidence supports the parallel trends assumption but likewise reveals no sharp or precisely estimated post-reform divergence in housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, these findings suggest that neither CEQA litigation intensity nor the LOS-to-VMT transition generated large, readily detectable effects on housing prices over the study period, at least as measured at the county and metropolitan levels. However, the results should not be interpreted as definitive evidence of the absence of CEQA-related supply effects. Future empirical research would benefit from richer project-level data on permitting timelines, litigation outcomes, and housing production, as well as from quasi-experimental designs exploiting localized regulatory changes, court rulings, or exemptions. More granular analyses of housing supply responses, density outcomes, and heterogeneity across market segments—particularly for multifamily and affordable housing—remain essential for understanding the mechanisms through which CEQA operates. As California and other states continue to reconsider the role of environmental review in land-use policy, credible causal evidence on the economic effects of CEQA will be critical for informing balanced reforms that reconcile environmental protection with housing affordability.\n"
