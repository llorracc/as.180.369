    "# Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "According to my review of the literature, there is significant economic research on the effects of environmental and other regulations on the housing market, but little economic research on CEQA's effects specifically. I will proceed in this review in three stages, each corresponding to one of three groups of literature relevant to my study of CEQA. In the first stage, I will focus on the general economics literature on the effects of government regulations on the housing market. Then, I will examine the economics literature on the effects of environmental regulations on the housing market. Lastly, I will do an overview of the literature on CEQA, which spans a variety of fields, from law to environmental policy, though with few contributions from the field of economics. My own study seeks to help address this economics-sized gap in the CEQA literature.\n",

    "## General Economics\n",
    "\n",
    "Glaeser and Gyourko (2003) examine the impacts of building restrictions on housing affordability and conclude that \"zoning, and other land-use controls, are more responsible for high prices where we see them\" (35). \"Measures of zoning strictness,\" they write, \"are highly correlated with high prices,\" and they recommend zoning reform to adress affordability (35). The authors find zoning restrictions to be especially cost-inducing in high-density urban areas, such as those in California, since they raise housing prices well above marginal construction costs. Similar effects are hypothesized to be occuring in the case of CEQA. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gyourko and Molloy (2015) argue that large differences in housing supply responsiveness across U.S. metropolitan areas are primarily driven by land-use regulation rather than construction costs or physical land scarcity, with regulation constraining quantities and causing demand shocks to translate into higher prices rather than increased housing supply. They emphasize that these regulatory constraints persist due to political economy forces favoring incumbent homeowners and stress the difficulty of causal identification, calling for quasi-experimental evidence based on policy changes. This framework is directly relevant to CEQA, as the statute’s environmental review and litigation provisions plausibly function as binding supply constraints, making episodes of CEQA reform—such as SB 743—particularly well-suited for causal analysis of regulatory impacts on housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hsieh and Moretti (2019) show that restrictive land-use regulations in high-productivity U.S. cities limit housing supply, preventing workers from relocating to where they are most productive and thereby generating substantial spatial misallocation of labor. Using a quantitative spatial equilibrium framework, they estimate that relaxing housing constraints in a small number of highly regulated metropolitan areas would significantly increase aggregate U.S. output. These findings are directly relevant to CEQA, as CEQA’s review and litigation processes may function as binding housing supply constraints in precisely these high-productivity regions, amplifying the broader economic costs of constrained housing supply beyond local affordability effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environmental Economics\n",
    "\n",
    "The economics literature examines both the demand- and supply-side effects of environmental regulation on housing markets, though the existing evidence is weighted heavily toward demand-side mechanisms. A large body of work shows that environmental regulations can raise housing prices by improving local environmental quality and neighborhood amenities. Much of this research relies on hedonic pricing models, which estimate the capitalization of government-protected environmental attributes—such as clean air, water quality, and preserved open space—into housing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive review of this literature is provided by Katherine Kiel (2004), who surveys studies assessing the housing market effects of environmental regulations at the federal, state, and local levels, ranging from the Clean Air Act to land-use and “smart growth” policies. While this body of work documents both demand- and supply-side channels in principle, it also highlights the relative paucity of research isolating supply-side effects. Building on the studies identified in Kiel’s review, early work by Benton and Pollack (1992) analyzes Maryland’s Critical Area Law and finds that environmental land-use protections were associated with stable vacant land values and rising residential property values, suggesting that environmental regulation can coexist with housing market appreciation. Subsequent studies reinforce the central role of environmental quality in shaping housing demand: Chay and Greenstone (2005) show that reductions in air pollution induced by the Clean Air Act increased county-level housing values using a difference-in-differences design with instrumental variables; Keiser and Shapiro (2019) document heterogeneous property market responses to Clean Water Act enforcement; Hanniger, Ma, and Timmins (2017) show that the remediation of contaminated sites increases nearby property values; and Atreya, Ferreira, and Kriesel (2013) find that improved flood risk information is capitalized into housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, this literature emphasizes the role of environmental regulation in increasing housing demand through improvements in environmental quality, leading to higher housing prices. While these studies provide important context for analyzing CEQA and motivate the use of quasi-experimental methods such as difference-in-differences, they also underscore a gap in the literature regarding the supply-side effects of environmental regulation on housing markets. Addressing this gap is particularly relevant for CEQA, where regulatory review processes and litigation risk may constrain housing supply rather than operate primarily through amenity-driven demand channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CEQA \n",
    "\n",
    "Turning to the literature examining CEQA and housing outcomes specifically, much of the existing research originates outside the economics discipline. A substantial share of this work is produced by legal scholars, policy analysts, and research institutes rather than by economists employing formal empirical methods. For example, legal scholar Jennifer Hernandez conducts a multi-part analysis of CEQA litigation, documenting how legal challenges can delay housing development and increase project costs across California. Related legal scholarship, including O'Neill, Biber, and Marantz (2023), as well as Elmendorf, Biber, Monkonnen, and O'Neill (2020), reviews the role of land-use regulations, including CEQA, in California’s housing affordability crisis and advances proposals for reform. In addition, California-based policy institutions—such as the Terner Center for Housing Innovation, the Public Policy Institute of California, and the UCLA Institute of Transportation Studies—regularly publish descriptive analyses and policy briefs addressing CEQA’s operation and potential impacts. Environmental advocacy organizations, including the California Association of Environmental Professionals and the Rose Foundation, have also commissioned studies evaluating CEQA, often questioning claims that the statute significantly constrains housing supply. While informative, this body of work is generally not grounded in the econometric identification strategies common in the economics literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "A prominent example is a 2018 study commissioned by the California Association of Environmental Professionals, which sought to assess CEQA’s role in California’s housing crisis and to identify potential avenues for reform. The authors note the absence of comprehensive, publicly available data on CEQA review practices, including the use of exemptions and streamlining provisions, underscoring the limited empirical evidence on the subject. The study is based on a statewide survey of cities and counties and, despite a low response rate of approximately 9 percent, received disproportionate participation from large jurisdictions with substantial housing development activity. The results indicate that streamlined review and statutory exemptions accounted for the plurality of housing projects (42 percent), followed by mitigated negative declarations (36 percent), while full environmental impact reports (EIRs) were required for only 6 percent of projects. These findings suggest that the most burdensome form of CEQA review is relatively uncommon, casting doubt on claims that EIR requirements are the primary mechanism through which CEQA constrains housing construction. At the same time, the study reports that affordable housing projects were less likely to qualify for exemptions and more likely to undergo EIR review, implying that CEQA’s burdens may fall disproportionately on subsidized developments. The authors further conclude that the perceived causal link between CEQA review and project withdrawal may be overstated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while this study and related policy analyses provide valuable descriptive insights into the administration of CEQA, their conclusions should be interpreted with caution. The reliance on survey data, low response rates, and the commissioning of the research by organizations with a direct stake in CEQA’s preservation highlight the need for independent, quasi-experimental economic analyses capable of credibly identifying the causal effects of CEQA on housing supply and prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, there is a substantial economics literature on government regulations, environmental policy and housing, and a significant literature on CEQA, though very few studies that bridge these domains. That is, there is very little economics literature on the housing market effects of CEQA specifically. In this paper, I will attempt to begin bridging this gap.  \n"
