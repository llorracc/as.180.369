"Economic Impact of Growth Management Policies Surrounding the Chesapeake Bay" by W. Patrick Benton and Marcus Pollock (1992). 
This study looks at the economic effects of land-use environmental protection policies. In particular, it studies the effects of Maryland's Critical Area Law on the housing market in the state. Overall, the study finds that the law had a positive overall effect on the market, as vacant land values held steady and residential housing values rose. This study shows how environmental policy can be crafted to balance environmental protection with developmental needs. 
"Environmental Regulations and the Housing Market: A Review of the Literature" by Katherine A. Kiel (2004).
This is a review of the existing literature on the relationship between environmental protection laws and the housing market. Although it was published in 2004, it is done by a leading economics scholar on environmental regulation and the housing market, so it provides a good roadmap to some other papers on the topic, including the above paper (Benton 1992). The review considers the effects of environmental laws on both the quantity and price of housing, as well as on factors such as the supply of land and other inputs that affect housing supply. The review also discusses studies that focus on how environmental regulations, by improving environmental quality, have driven up demand, and therefore prices, for housing in some cases. Relatively few scholars have focused on the supply side as opposed to the demand side of the housing market when it comes to the effects of environmental regulation.
