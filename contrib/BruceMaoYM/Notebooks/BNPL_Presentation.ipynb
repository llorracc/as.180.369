    "- The sector's rapid growth and concentration among financially vulnerable consumers suggests continued monitoring and research as monetary policy environment evolves\n",
    "- BNPL sector's rapid growth creates need for close monitoring\n",
    "- Thin margins and wholesale funding create vulnerabilities\n",
    "- Consider how monetary policy and regulation interact to affect consumer credit access"
