Abstract 
As young adults continue to online shop, Buy Now, Pay Later has become increasingly appealing—but the firms offering these services are trading at valuations that don't match their underlying credit risk. This paper tests whether BNPL firms are systematically mispriced by running panel regressions on valuations and examining how stock prices respond to credit deterioration. The story fits Minsky's financial instability hypothesis: BNPL exploded during the 2019-2024 expansion when interest rates were low and fiscal stimulus was flowing. Because these loans largely aren't reported to credit bureaus, the risks accumulated invisibly. Now the evidence of strain is mounting. CFPB data shows 21% of credit-active Americans use BNPL, with 63% holding multiple loans simultaneously and 42% making late payments. Younger borrowers have concentrated heavily in BNPL, holding 28% of their unsecured debt in these products. Yet despite serving this fragile consumer base, Affirm and Klarna trade at 6-7 times revenue—multiples characteristic of technology platforms rather than consumer lenders. My panel regressions quantify the disconnect: BNPL firms command 40-60% valuation premiums over traditional lenders after controlling for growth, profitability, and credit losses. Market efficiency tests reveal an even more striking pattern—BNPL stock prices don't respond to rising complaint rates and loan stacking that reliably predict charge-offs in traditional lending. DCF modeling under credit stress scenarios exposes the problem: current valuations require permanently strong growth and stable credit performance that contradict observable consumer fragility. The findings point to systematic market failure in pricing endogenous credit risk when financial innovations operate outside normal regulatory visibility. This research shows how regulatory complaint data can identify mispricing before it appears in financial statements, and demonstrates that CFPB oversight serves financial stability functions beyond consumer protection.

Thesis Statement 
As BNPL adoption has surged among young, credit-constrained consumers, market valuations have diverged sharply from credit fundamentals: panel regressions reveal BNPL firms receive 40-60% valuation premiums over traditional lenders with comparable growth and credit metrics, while market efficiency tests show their stock prices fail to respond to credit deterioration that predicts defaults in traditional lending—a pattern consistent with Minsky's prediction that financial innovations generate persistent mispricing when incomplete reporting masks the fragilities building during stable periods.
