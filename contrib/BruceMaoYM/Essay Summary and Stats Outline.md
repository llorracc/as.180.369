# BNPL Comparative Studies

---

## The Australian BNPL Experience (Powell et al., 2023)

The Australian study surveyed 360 BNPL users, evenly split between those under and over 25 years old, with 60% female and 40% male participants. Using online surveys with Likert scales and structural equation modeling for analysis, the researchers uncovered deeply concerning patterns about consumer engagement with BNPL services.

The most striking finding relates to how users interact with terms and conditions. Nearly half of respondents (47%) spent less than five minutes reading these crucial documents. The time investment correlated directly with comprehension levels: those who claimed to *completely* understand averaged 15 minutes of reading, while those admitting to *not at all* understanding spent merely 2 minutes. Despite this minimal engagement, only 48.7% agreed they clearly understood the terms, and alarmingly, 30% did not understand how missed payments would impact their credit records. When asked why they didn’t read the terms thoroughly, users cited predictable but troubling reasons: documents were *too long*, *boring*, *complicated*, or they simply *couldn’t be bothered*.

The financial consequences of this casual approach became evident in the payment data. A substantial 43.6% of all respondents had missed at least one payment, with 26.2% experiencing financial difficulty directly attributable to BNPL usage. The strategies users employed to meet BNPL obligations revealed the depth of financial strain: 17.4% became overdrawn on their bank accounts, 15.6% had to borrow from family and friends, and 13.2% delayed essential bills like electricity and rent. Compounding these issues, 59.8% were juggling multiple BNPL payments simultaneously.

Age-based analysis revealed younger users facing disproportionate challenges. Among those under 25, 48% had missed payments compared to 39% of older users. Their financial wellbeing scores averaged **2.53** versus **2.30** for older users (where higher scores indicate worse conditions). Younger users were more likely to disagree with statements about responsible financial behavior (17.1% vs 11.8%) and had to borrow from family and friends more frequently (18.5% vs 13.0%). Notably, 42.8% of younger users did not possess credit cards, compared to only 26.1% of older users, suggesting BNPL fills a credit access gap for younger consumers.

Behavioral patterns painted a picture of impulsive and compulsive consumption. Nearly half (44.2%) agreed they often made spontaneous BNPL purchases, while 36.9% admitted buying things they couldn’t afford. The psychological burden was evident: 29.8% felt others would be horrified by their spending habits. Most concerning was the overlap between behaviors—68.3% of impulse buyers also engaged in compulsive buying. Despite these risky behaviors, only 46.4% used formal budgets, while 43.1% relied on “mental” budgets.

The structural equation modeling revealed crucial relationships. Thorough examination of terms and conditions had the strongest positive impact on financial wellbeing (**0.40, p < 0.01**), followed by planning and budgeting (**0.23, p < 0.01**). Compulsive buying negatively impacted wellbeing (**-0.11, p < 0.01**), while impulse buying strongly predicted compulsive buying (**0.36, p < 0.01**). Surprisingly, neither using debit versus credit cards nor having multiple BNPL purchases showed significant impact on financial wellbeing, suggesting users may not recognize these as risk factors.

## The Italian BNPL Landscape (Cervellati et al., 2024)

The Italian study encompassed a larger sample of 1,457 participants, revealing different demographic patterns. The age distribution skewed older than the Australian study: 37.7% were 30–40 years old, 20.3% were 41–50, and 30.1% were 51–60, with only 11.9% over 60. Gender balance was nearly even (49% female, 50.9% male, 0.1% non-binary). Income levels centered on middle earners, with 39.7% earning €20,000–€40,000 and 23.3% earning €10,000–€20,000. The employment profile showed stability, with 72.2% in full-time positions and 13.3% part-time. Educational attainment was relatively high: 41.9% had completed high school or college, and 26% held master’s degrees.

Despite Italy’s traditionally conservative approach to credit, BNPL showed significant penetration and potential. While only 12% currently used BNPL services, a substantial 33.6% identified as prospective users wanting to adopt the service. E-commerce engagement was moderate, with 24.7% shopping monthly and 25% every 2–3 months. Financial literacy assessment revealed concerning gaps: only 41.9% demonstrated high literacy, while 34.8% showed medium and 23.4% poor literacy levels.

Principal component analysis identified four distinct behavioral factors with strong reliability scores: **Financial Literacy (α = 0.811)**, **Financial Diligence (α = 0.836)**, **Financing Preference (α = 0.701)**, and **Financial Over-Indebtedness (α = 0.737)**. These factors helped explain user behavior patterns.

Logistic regression analysis of current BNPL users revealed counterintuitive patterns. Older individuals were more likely to use BNPL (**+0.040**), contradicting assumptions about younger adoption. Lower education strongly predicted usage (**-0.193**), as did lower financial literacy (**-0.369**) and reduced financial diligence (**-0.311**). Paradoxically, less frequent e-commerce shoppers were more likely to use BNPL (**+0.439**), suggesting purposeful seeking of the service rather than casual adoption. Trust in the financial system showed negative correlation (**-0.113**), while preference for financing showed strong positive correlation (**+0.523**).

Analysis of prospective users revealed similar but intensified patterns. Lower income significantly predicted interest (**-0.222**), and distrust in financial systems was even stronger (**-0.393**) than among current users. Financial literacy showed the same strong negative correlation (**-0.393**), while financing preference remained positive (**+0.160**), though weaker than current users.

The “gateway effect” emerged as a critical finding. Linear regression on 664 respondents demonstrated that BNPL users were **0.307 times more likely** to adopt additional consumer credit (p < 0.01), with prospects showing even stronger likelihood (**0.347, p < 0.01**). This effect persisted even when controlling for demographics and financial behaviors, suggesting BNPL fundamentally alters credit-seeking behavior.

## Critical Cross-Study Insights

Both studies converge on a financial literacy crisis. The Australian data showed those with poor planning and budgeting were 11.5% more likely to experience problems, while Italian data revealed financial literacy coefficients of **-0.369 to -0.393**, confirming that the least financially literate are most attracted to BNPL services. This creates a dangerous mismatch between product complexity and user capability.

Demographic vulnerabilities emerged consistently across both studies. In Australia, 25% of young users fell into financial trouble categories, while in Italy, lower-income individuals showed significantly higher interest in BNPL adoption. Both studies demonstrated inverse relationships between education levels and BNPL usage, suggesting vulnerability clusters around young, less-educated, lower-income populations.

Behavioral red flags appeared in both contexts. The Australian study’s finding that 68.3% of impulse buyers also engaged in compulsive buying paralleled the Italian study’s strong financing preference coefficient (**0.523**) among users. The speed of decision-making—with most users spending under 5 minutes on terms—appeared in both studies as a critical risk factor.

A trust paradox emerged from the Italian data, where those distrusting financial institutions were more likely to use BNPL, with coefficients of **-0.113** for users and **-0.393** for prospects. This suggests BNPL is viewed as an alternative to traditional banking, potentially attracting those already marginalized from conventional financial services.

Perhaps most concerning is what both studies term the *invisible risk*. The Australian study found no significant wellbeing difference between single versus multiple BNPL accounts, while the Italian study’s over-indebtedness factor proved non-significant for current users. This suggests users don’t perceive accumulating BNPL debt as risky, potentially enabling dangerous debt spirals before recognition of financial distress.

## Conclusion

Together, these studies paint a comprehensive picture of BNPL as a financial product that systematically attracts and potentially harms the most vulnerable consumers, while serving as a gateway to broader consumer debt adoption, all while operating in a regulatory environment that fails to provide traditional consumer credit protections.

# Comprehensive Formula Framework for BNPL Analysis

## I. Core Valuation (DCF)

The backbone of any BNPL firm valuation is a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. For Affirm, the DCF must be tailored to account for credit losses and regulatory costs, which weigh more heavily than in typical fintech or SaaS models.

**Enterprise Value (EV): EV = Σ (FCFt / (1 + WACC)^t) + TV / (1 + WACC)^n

Where:  
- **FCF** = Free Cash Flow = Revenue – Operating Costs – Credit Losses – Regulatory Costs – CapEx – ΔNWC  
- **WACC** = Weighted Average Cost of Capital (risk-adjusted for Affirm)  
- **TV** = Terminal Value = `FCFn × (1 + g) / (WACC – g)`  
- **n** = Projection period  

---

## II. Credit Risk (ECL)

BNPL valuation is inseparable from credit performance. Affirm discloses delinquency and charge-off data, which can be used to approximate default risk.

**Expected Credit Loss (ECL):ECL = EAD × PD × LGD

Where:  
- **EAD** = Exposure at Default (outstanding BNPL balances)  
- **PD** = Probability of Default (delinquency → default transition)  
- **LGD** = Loss Given Default (1 – recovery rate)  

This formula lets us embed Affirm’s credit quality directly into the DCF.

## III. Valuation–Risk Disconnect (Regression)

To test whether BNPL valuations are inflated relative to risk, we can estimate a cross-sectional regression. The idea: do firms like Affirm trade at a premium even after accounting for complaints and losses?

# Valuation–Risk Analysis Framework for BNPL

This section explores how to link BNPL firm valuations (like Affirm’s) with consumer risk indicators.  
It includes both a **simple comparative ratio method** (practical with available data) and an **optional regression framework** (for future expansion).

---

## Part 1. Comparative Ratio Method (Recommended Core)

This approach avoids statistical complexity and instead compares valuation multiples with risk metrics across firms.  
It is implementable with public data.

**Table Structure Example:**

| Firm        | EV/Revenue | Complaints per User | Credit Loss Rate | BNPL? |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|------------------|-------|
| Affirm      | [Extract from 10-K] | [Extract from CFPB DB] | [Extract from 10-K] | Yes |
| SoFi        | [Extract from 10-K] | [CFPB DB]              | [10-K/Q]            | No  |
| LendingClub | [Extract from 10-K] | [CFPB DB]              | [10-K/Q]            | No  |
| PayPal      | [Extract from 10-K] | [CFPB DB]              | [10-K/Q]            | Mixed |

**Data Sources:**  
- **EV/Revenue** → From market data (Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, or SEC filings).  
- **Complaints/User** → CFPB Consumer Complaint Database (search by firm, divide by reported active users).  
- **Credit Loss Rate** → From each firm’s 10-K/10-Q (net charge-offs ÷ balances).  

This method lets you directly eyeball whether BNPL firms (like Affirm) trade at higher multiples despite worse complaint and credit-loss profiles.  

---

## Part 2. Regression Framework

If you want to formalize the comparison, you can set up a regression.  
This requires a broader sample of firms (BNPL and traditional fintech lenders).

**Specification:**
PE_Ratioi = β0 + β1(BNPL_Dummy) + β2(Complaints_per_User)*(BNPL_Dummy) + β3(Credit_Loss_Rate)(BNPL_Dummy) + εi

Where:  
- **PE_Ratioᵢ** = Firm i’s Price/Earnings ratio (or EV/Revenue if negative earnings).  
  - *Source:* Market data (Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg).  
- **BNPL_Dummy** = 1 if firm is BNPL (Affirm, Klarna), 0 if not.  
  - *Source:* Classification by business model.  
- **Complaints_per_User** = CFPB complaints ÷ active users.  
  - *Source:* CFPB Complaint Database + firm filings (active users).  
- **Credit_Loss_Rate** = Net charge-offs ÷ outstanding balances.  
  - *Source:* 10-K/10-Q filings.  

**Interpretation:**  
- If **β1 > 0** even after controlling for complaints and credit losses, this suggests BNPL firms receive a valuation premium not explained by fundamentals.  
- If **β2 < 0** or **β3 < 0**, this confirms risk indicators reduce valuations as expected.  

⚠️ **Caution:** With very few public BNPL firms, regression results may be unstable. Treat this more as an **academic extension** than a core empirical test.

## Part 3. Practical Recommendation

- Start with the **comparative ratio table** for Affirm vs peers.  
- Add regression as an **optional appendix** in your GitHub repo — label it as “future work.”  
- Always **cite data sources clearly**:  
  - Affirm 10-K/10-Q → Revenue, GMV, net charge-offs, active users.  
  - CFPB Complaint Database → Complaints by firm.  
  - Market data (Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg) → Multiples like EV/Revenue or P/E.

## IV. BNPL Risk Dashboard

For ongoing monitoring, a set of key ratios provides a quick view of Affirm’s risk-return profile:

- **Take Rate** = Revenue ÷ GMV  
- **Charge-off Rate** = Net charge-offs ÷ balances  
- **Delinquency Rate** = Past-due ÷ total balances  
- **Coverage Ratio** = Loan loss provisions ÷ non-performing loans  
- **EV/Revenue** = Enterprise Value ÷ trailing-twelve-month revenue  

These metrics make cross-firm comparisons straightforward.

---

## V. Stress Testing (Optional)

Scenario analysis adds robustness. Instead of complex Monte Carlo simulations, simple recession shocks are enough:

**Recession Shock Example:**
Stressed_PD = Base_PD × (1 + Unemployment_Beta × ΔUnemployment)
Stressed_Revenue = Base_Revenue × (1 – Consumption_Beta × ΔGDP)

This shows how Affirm’s losses and revenues react to macro shocks.
