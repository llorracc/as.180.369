## 5. Summary and Conclusions

## 5.1 Research Question and Methodology

This study addresses a fundamental question in financial economics: How do Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) firms' stock returns respond to changes in the Federal Funds Rate, after controlling for market movements, consumer spending patterns, credit market conditions, and other macroeconomic factors?

This question is motivated by the unique funding structure of BNPL firms, which rely heavily on warehouse credit facilities, securitization, and sale-and-repurchase agreements that create immediate pass-through of interest rate changes to funding costs. This is documented in the firm-level study of Affirm Holdings Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. 10-K filings.

This study employs a log-linear regression framework, examining monthly log-transformed BNPL stock returns as a function of Federal Funds Rate changes and a comprehensive set of control variables that capture market movements, consumer behavior, and macroeconomic factors. This methodological approach, detailed in Section 4 (Empirical Results), allows us to isolate the effect of interest rate changes on BNPL returns while controlling for other factors that might confound the relationship.

The empirical study spans the period from February 2020 to August 2025, comprising 67 monthly observations that capture both the rapid growth phase of the BNPL industry and significant monetary policy shifts, including the Federal Reserve's transition from near-zero interest rates to approximately 5% over the sample period. This substantial variation in monetary policy provides strong identification for estimating interest rate sensitivity, as the dramatic shift from accommodative to restrictive monetary policy creates a natural experiment for examining how BNPL firms respond to rate changes.

### 5.2 Key Empirical Findings

The primary finding, detailed in Section 4 (Empirical Results), is that the coefficient on Federal Funds Rate changes in the full specification model is estimated as β₁ = -12.68, with a robust standard error of 9.89. The point estimate suggests that a one percentage point increase in Federal Funds Rate changes is associated with approximately a 12.7% decrease in log BNPL returns. However, this coefficient is economically large but statistically indistinguishable from zero (p-value = 0.202). The 95% confidence interval ranges from approximately -32.4 to 7.0, which includes zero and reflects substantial uncertainty around the point estimate.

The statistical insignificance does not imply that no relationship exists, but rather reflects the limited sample size (67 monthly observations) and high volatility of stock returns, which reduce statistical power to detect relationships that may be economically meaningful. The negative sign and magnitude of the coefficient are consistent with theoretical expectations regarding the impact of monetary policy on BNPL firm performance, as discussed in Section 3 (Literature Review). However, given the wide confidence interval and lack of statistical significance, these results should be interpreted with caution. The relationship may exist but cannot be detected with the current sample size and identification strategy. See Section 7 (Limitations) for a detailed discussion of these constraints.

The full specification model achieves an R² of 0.5098, meaning that the included variables (Federal Funds Rate changes, consumer confidence changes, disposable income changes, inflation changes, and market returns) collectively explain approximately 51% of the variation in log BNPL returns. This represents a substantial improvement over the base model's R² of 0.0224, indicating that controlling for market movements and other macroeconomic factors is important for understanding BNPL return dynamics. The improvement in R² of 0.4875 (representing a 2,179.6% increase) validates the multi-factor approach.

The market return coefficient is highly statistically significant (β₅ = 2.38, p-value < 0.001), indicating that BNPL returns move strongly with broader market movements. This finding is consistent with standard asset pricing theory, particularly the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), and indicates that systematic risk factors play an important role in determining BNPL stock performance. The magnitude of this coefficient (2.38) indicates that BNPL stocks exhibit substantially higher market beta than the average stock, suggesting that BNPL firms are highly sensitive to systematic market risk. The inflation coefficient is also statistically significant (β₄ = -12.94, p-value = 0.049), indicating that inflation is an important determinant of BNPL stock performance. This negative relationship likely operates through multiple channels: inflation erodes consumer purchasing power, reducing discretionary spending capacity and BNPL transaction volume; inflation increases funding costs through its effect on nominal interest rates; and inflation creates economic uncertainty that affects consumer confidence and credit demand.

The consumer confidence and disposable income coefficients are not statistically significant at conventional levels, though the consumer confidence coefficient approaches significance (p-value = 0.102). The lack of statistical significance for these variables may reflect several factors: the limited sample size reduces statistical power for detecting relationships; high volatility in BNPL returns creates substantial noise that masks underlying relationships; the dominance of market returns and inflation may capture much of the variation that would otherwise be attributed to consumer confidence and disposable income; and potential measurement issues or temporal lags in how these variables affect BNPL stock returns. Despite the lack of statistical significance, the theoretical motivation for including these variables remains strong, as the literature review demonstrates clear relationships between consumer sentiment, disposable income, and BNPL demand.

## 5.3 Model Fit and Robustness

The comparison between base and full specification models, detailed in Section 4, demonstrates the importance of controlling for multiple economic channels. The base model, which includes only interest rate changes, achieves an R² of 0.0224, indicating that interest rates alone explain very little of the variation in BNPL returns. The full specification model, which includes market returns, consumer confidence, disposable income, and inflation, achieves an R² of 0.5098. This represents a substantial improvement.

The interest rate coefficient remains relatively stable across specifications (-12.51 in the base model versus -12.68 in the full model). This indicates that the estimated interest rate sensitivity is robust to the inclusion of control variables. This robustness addresses concerns about omitted variable bias, as discussed in Section 4, and indicates that interest rate changes may have a direct effect on BNPL stock returns, independent of their correlation with other economic factors.

However, the model's explanatory power remains moderate, with approximately 49% of the variance in BNPL returns unexplained by my variables. This unexplained variance reflects the inherent difficulty of predicting stock returns, which are driven by many factors including firm-specific news (earnings announcements, product launches, management changes), regulatory changes (such as the CFPB's May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit cards), competitive dynamics, and investor sentiment that are not captured in my macroeconomic model. The substantial unexplained variance is consistent with the efficient markets hypothesis, which posits that stock prices incorporate all available information, and is typical for financial return models. The R² of 0.5098 achieved by my full specification model compares favorably to other studies examining stock return sensitivity to macroeconomic variables, indicating that my model captures a substantial portion of the systematic variation in BNPL returns.

## 5.4 Limitations and Scope

This study faces several important limitations that affect the interpretation of results. A comprehensive discussion of these limitations is provided in Section 7 (Limitations), which addresses sample size constraints, shock identification challenges, dependent variable construction issues, missing factor controls, diagnostic limitations, generalizability concerns, and causal interpretation challenges.

Key limitations include: (1) limited sample size (67 monthly observations) reducing statistical power; (2) use of crude shock measure ($\Delta FFR$) that does not provide clean identification of exogenous monetary policy shocks; (3) portfolio approach that masks firm-level heterogeneity; (4) omission of standard asset pricing factors (Fama-French factors, VIX, sector ETFs); and (5) inability to establish causality from observational data alone.

These limitations require that results be interpreted with appropriate caution. Our findings should be viewed as exploratory/descriptive rather than definitive causal evidence. Despite these limitations, the analysis provides valuable descriptive evidence on BNPL firms' sensitivity to monetary policy changes and establishes a foundation for future research with improved identification strategies.

## 5.5 Policy Implications

Despite the statistical insignificance of the interest rate coefficient, the analysis provides descriptive insights for monetary policy, financial regulation, and investment decision-making, particularly when considered alongside the firm-level evidence presented in Section 3. However, these insights should be interpreted with caution given the limitations discussed in Section 7.

The theoretical framework and empirical literature, combined with firm-level analysis of Affirm Holdings Inc., strongly suggest that BNPL firms should be sensitive to interest rate changes due to their funding structure and thin profit margins. As documented in Section 3, Affirm's funding costs increased by 394% from fiscal year 2022 to 2024, with management attributing this increase primarily to higher benchmark interest rates. This firm-level evidence provides microeconomic support for the macroeconomic relationship identified in my regression analysis, even though the regression coefficient is not statistically significant.

For monetary policymakers, the point estimate suggests that BNPL firms may be disproportionately affected by interest rate increases, though the wide confidence interval and lack of statistical significance indicate substantial uncertainty. The funding structure of BNPL firms creates immediate pass-through of rate increases to funding costs, which may affect their profitability and lending capacity. However, the statistical insignificance and limitations discussed in Section 7 indicate that other factors may dominate BNPL returns in the short term, making it difficult to isolate the interest rate effect with current data and methods.

For financial regulators, the analysis highlights the importance of monitoring BNPL firms' funding structures and interest rate risk exposure. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit cards may affect BNPL firms' regulatory environment and funding costs, potentially amplifying their sensitivity to interest rate changes. Regulators should consider how monetary policy changes affect BNPL firms' profitability and lending capacity. This is particularly important given their role in providing credit to subprime consumers who may be particularly vulnerable to economic downturns.

For investors, the point estimate suggests that BNPL stocks may exhibit sensitivity to interest rate changes, though the wide confidence interval and lack of statistical significance indicate substantial uncertainty. The high market beta (β₅ = 2.38, p-value < 0.001) indicates that BNPL stocks are highly sensitive to broader market movements, which should be considered when evaluating investment risk. Investors should consider the possibility of interest rate sensitivity when evaluating BNPL stocks, particularly during periods of monetary policy tightening. However, the statistical insignificance and limitations discussed in Section 7 indicate that other factors, including firm-specific news, regulatory changes, and competitive dynamics, may dominate returns in the short term, making it difficult to isolate interest rate effects.

## 5.6 Future Research Directions

Several directions for future research emerge from this analysis, building on the limitations and robustness considerations discussed in Section 4.

First, as more data becomes available with the passage of time, future studies will be able to examine BNPL interest rate sensitivity with larger sample sizes and greater statistical power. The BNPL industry is still relatively new, and as firms accumulate more quarterly earnings reports and experience more monetary policy cycles, researchers will be able to provide more definitive evidence on interest rate sensitivity. A larger sample size would increase statistical power and potentially allow detection of relationships that exist but are not statistically significant in my current sample.

Second, future research could examine alternative model specifications, including non-linear relationships, lagged effects, and interaction terms that capture how BNPL sensitivity varies across different economic conditions. As discussed in Section 4, the relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns may be non-linear, with sensitivity increasing at higher rate levels, or may operate with lags as firms adjust their funding structures and pricing in response to rate changes. Alternative specifications could help address these possibilities.

Third, future research could incorporate firm-level panel data, examining how individual BNPL firms' funding structures, profit margins, and business models affect their sensitivity to interest rate changes. Panel data analysis with firm fixed effects could provide more precise estimates by controlling for unobserved firm characteristics and exploiting within-firm variation over time. This would build on the firm-level analysis presented in Section 3, providing more granular insights into heterogeneity across firms.

Fourth, future research could examine how regulatory changes, such as the CFPB's May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit cards, affect BNPL firms' interest rate sensitivity. This regulatory change may alter BNPL firms' funding structures, regulatory compliance costs, and competitive positioning, potentially affecting their sensitivity to monetary policy changes. Examining how sensitivity varies before and after regulatory changes could provide insights into the mechanisms through which monetary policy affects BNPL firms.

Fifth, future research could employ alternative identification strategies to address causality concerns. For example, instrumental variables approaches, natural experiments, or event studies around Federal Reserve policy announcements could provide more credible causal estimates. These approaches would help address the limitations of observational data discussed in Section 4.

This analysis establishes an empirical foundation for understanding BNPL firms' sensitivity to monetary policy while highlighting the methodological challenges inherent in detecting relationships in financial returns data with limited sample sizes. The firm-level evidence presented in Section 3 provides microeconomic support for the macroeconomic relationship identified in the regression analysis, even though the regression coefficient is not statistically significant.

## 5.7 Synthesis of Empirical Findings and Their Interpretation

This section synthesizes the empirical findings presented in Section 4, providing a comprehensive interpretation of the results and their implications for understanding BNPL stock behavior, monetary policy transmission, and asset pricing theory.

### 5.7.1 Interest Rate Sensitivity: Statistical Evidence and Economic Magnitude

The primary empirical finding is that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no relationship between Federal Funds Rate changes and BNPL stock returns. The estimated coefficient (β₁ = -12.68) is economically substantial but statistically insignificant (p-value = 0.202), with a 95% confidence interval [-32.18, 6.81] that includes zero. This null result indicates that, conditional on the included control variables, we find no statistically significant evidence that BNPL stock returns respond to interest rate changes in monthly data.

The economic magnitude of the point estimate warrants attention: a one percentage point increase in the Federal Funds Rate is associated with an estimated 12.7% decrease in log BNPL returns. This magnitude suggests that if a relationship exists, it would be economically meaningful—a typical 0.5 percentage point policy move would correspond to approximately a 6.4% decline in BNPL returns. However, the statistical insignificance and wide confidence interval reflect substantial uncertainty around this estimate, precluding definitive conclusions about the relationship's existence or magnitude.

### 5.7.2 Explaining the Divergence Between Economic Magnitude and Statistical Significance

Three factors explain why an economically large coefficient fails to achieve statistical significance. First, BNPL stocks exhibit extremely high volatility, with a monthly standard deviation of 12.34%, creating substantial noise that obscures systematic relationships. When return variance is dominated by idiosyncratic factors, even economically meaningful effects may fail to achieve statistical significance given limited sample size.

Second, market returns dominate BNPL return variation, explaining 51% of variation (R² = 0.51) in the full specification model. This dominance leaves limited residual variation for interest rates to explain, reducing the precision with which we can estimate the interest rate coefficient. The high market beta (β = 2.38, p < 0.001) indicates that systematic market factors capture most of the systematic variation in BNPL returns, potentially obscuring the relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns.

Third, Federal Funds Rate changes occur infrequently, with many zero observations (rate unchanged for multiple months) creating low-frequency variation that reduces statistical power. This measurement challenge, combined with high return volatility and market dominance, explains why economically meaningful relationships may fail to achieve statistical significance in monthly return data.

### 5.7.3 Determinants of BNPL Stock Returns: Empirical Evidence

The empirical analysis reveals that market returns are the dominant determinant of BNPL stock performance. The market return coefficient (β₅ = 2.38, p-value < 0.001) indicates that BNPL stocks exhibit a market beta substantially higher than the average stock (β ≈ 1.0), placing them among the highest-beta securities in the market. This high beta means that BNPL stocks amplify market movements, rising more than the market during bull markets and falling more during bear markets.

Inflation also exhibits statistically significant effects (β₄ = -12.94, p-value = 0.049), operating through multiple channels: erosion of consumer purchasing power reduces discretionary spending and BNPL transaction volume; inflation increases funding costs through its effect on nominal interest rates; and inflation creates economic uncertainty affecting consumer confidence and credit demand.

In contrast, interest rates, consumer confidence, and disposable income do not achieve statistical significance at conventional levels. The interest rate coefficient is economically large but statistically insignificant (p-value = 0.202), consumer confidence approaches significance (p-value = 0.102), and disposable income is not significant (p-value = 0.493). This pattern suggests that market sentiment and inflation dominate BNPL stock performance, while interest rate sensitivity, if present, is obscured by other factors or operates through indirect channels that do not manifest in monthly return data.

### 5.7.4 Implications for Investment Decision-Making

The empirical findings have important implications for portfolio construction and risk management. The high market beta (β = 2.38) indicates that BNPL stocks amplify systematic market risk, meaning that during a 10% market decline, BNPL stocks would be expected to decline by approximately 24%. This high beta makes BNPL stocks particularly risky during market downturns but potentially rewarding during bull markets, consistent with growth-oriented technology stock behavior.

The lack of statistically significant interest rate sensitivity suggests that investors should focus on market sentiment, competitive dynamics, and regulatory developments rather than attempting to time monetary policy. However, the economic magnitude of the interest rate coefficient (-12.68) suggests that investors should not completely dismiss interest rate risk, particularly during periods of rapid policy changes. The high volatility (12.34% monthly standard deviation, approximately 43% annualized) indicates substantial risk, but this risk comes primarily from market sensitivity rather than interest rate sensitivity.

### 5.7.5 Implications for Monetary Policy and Financial Regulation

The empirical findings suggest that BNPL firms may represent a distinct channel of monetary policy transmission that operates differently from traditional financial intermediaries. While stock returns do not exhibit statistically significant sensitivity to interest rate changes, firm-level evidence demonstrates that funding costs do affect BNPL operations. Affirm's funding costs increased by 394% from fiscal year 2022 to 2024, with management attributing this increase primarily to higher benchmark interest rates. This divergence between firm-level profitability and stock-level returns raises important questions about how monetary policy affects BNPL firms' operations versus how investors price these effects in equity markets.

Policymakers should recognize that BNPL firms' funding structures create immediate pass-through of interest rate changes to funding costs, potentially affecting profitability and lending capacity even if stock returns do not reflect this sensitivity. Regulators should monitor BNPL firms' funding structures and interest rate risk exposure, particularly given their role in serving subprime consumers who may be vulnerable to economic downturns. The CFPB's regulatory changes, including the May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit cards, may alter BNPL firms' sensitivity to monetary policy by changing their funding structures, regulatory compliance costs, and competitive positioning, requiring ongoing assessment of how regulatory frameworks interact with monetary policy transmission.

### 5.7.6 Market Efficiency and Asset Pricing Implications

The divergence between firm-level evidence (demonstrating funding cost sensitivity) and stock-level evidence (showing no statistically significant return sensitivity) raises questions about market efficiency and investor attention to fundamental factors. This pattern suggests several possible interpretations: investors may price BNPL stocks based on growth expectations and market sentiment rather than fundamental funding costs; the effects of funding costs may be obscured by other dominant factors (market movements, competitive dynamics); or the sensitivity operates through indirect channels that do not manifest in monthly return data.

This pattern is consistent with growth stock behavior, where investors focus on long-term growth prospects rather than short-term cost factors. The high market beta and dominance of market returns in explaining BNPL return variation suggest that BNPL stocks are priced similarly to growth-oriented technology companies rather than rate-sensitive financial institutions, despite BNPL firms' structural exposure to funding costs. This pricing behavior reflects the sector's status as a growth industry where future prospects matter more than current profitability, potentially explaining why interest rate sensitivity does not manifest in monthly stock return data.

**Contributions and Future Directions**

This study provides the first systematic econometric analysis of BNPL stock sensitivity to monetary policy. The null result itself is informative: investors price BNPL stocks more similarly to growth-oriented technology companies than to rate-sensitive financial institutions, despite BNPL firms' structural exposure to funding costs.

As the BNPL industry matures and accumulates more data across multiple monetary policy cycles, future research will be able to provide more definitive evidence on interest rate sensitivity. The methodological framework established here—combining portfolio-level regression analysis with firm-level financial data—provides a template for future studies examining how monetary policy affects fintech firms and alternative credit providers.

Future research examining the relationship between BNPL firms' actual profitability and interest rates, independent of stock price movements, would provide crucial insights into whether the null result reflects investor inattention or efficient pricing of other dominant factors.
