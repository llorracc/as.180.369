    "## 3. Data Analysis: Interest Rate Sensitivity and Economic Determinants\n",
    "\n",
    "This study examines factors associated with Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) stock returns, with particular attention to the sector's sensitivity to monetary policy changes and broader macroeconomic conditions. The study employs a log-linear regression framework to estimate relationships between BNPL stock returns and a set of economic variables, including interest rate changes, consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation, and market returns. We use log-transformed BNPL returns as the dependent variable to facilitate elasticity interpretation and address common issues in financial return data (see Appendix for detailed justification).\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling strategy employs a two-stage approach, beginning with a parsimonious base specification that examines the relationship between BNPL returns and interest rate changes, followed by a full specification model that incorporates multiple economic channels simultaneously. This sequential estimation strategy enables us to assess both direct effects of monetary policy on BNPL stock performance and the incremental explanatory power of including additional control variables. All models are estimated using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression with robust standard errors (HC3) to address heteroskedasticity, which is a common feature of financial return data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation for this work stems from the rapid growth and increasing economic significance of the BNPL sector. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's 2025 report, BNPL adoption has experienced substantial growth, with 21% of consumers with credit records utilizing BNPL services in 2022, representing an increase from 18% in 2021. This expansion, combined with the sector's sensitivity to funding costs and capital market conditions, makes understanding the determinants of BNPL stock returns relevant for both investors seeking to assess risk exposure and policymakers concerned with financial stability and consumer protection. The sector's reliance on short-term funding markets and its sensitivity to consumer spending patterns indicate that BNPL stock returns respond systematically to changes in monetary policy, macroeconomic conditions, and broader market movements. The extent and nature of these relationships are the focus of this analysis."

    "## 3.1 Data Construction and Variable Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes the data construction process and the rationale for variable selection in our econometric models. The empirical analysis requires careful construction of a balanced panel dataset that aligns stock return data with macroeconomic variables measured at different frequencies and from different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.1 BNPL Portfolio Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Firm Selection and Sample Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis includes three publicly-traded BNPL firms: PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL), Affirm Holdings Inc. (AFRM), and Sezzle Inc. (SEZL). These firms were selected based on criteria established in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Market Trends Report, which identifies major BNPL providers in the U.S. market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several important limitations affect this firm selection. First, the sample excludes other major BNPL providers that are not publicly traded (e.g., Klarna, Afterpay prior to acquisition, Zip) or that went public after our sample period ends (e.g., Klarna IPO in September 2025). Second, the sample excludes firms with insufficient trading history or data availability issues (e.g., Block/Square's BNPL operations are not separately traded). Third, the sample may suffer from survivorship bias, as only firms that survived and went public are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations mean our results may not generalize to the broader BNPL sector, particularly smaller providers or those operating under different business models. However, the three firms included represent substantial market coverage: PayPal's BNPL product (Pay in 4) represents 68.1% of U.S. BNPL market share, making it the largest BNPL provider. Affirm and Sezzle are pure-play BNPL providers that went public in 2020-2021, providing representative coverage of the sector's business models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Portfolio Weighting: Equal vs. Value Weighting**\n",
    "\n",
    "We construct the BNPL portfolio using equal weighting, where each firm receives equal weight regardless of market capitalization. This approach has both advantages and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equal weighting reduces the dominance of PayPal, which has substantially larger market capitalization than Affirm or Sezzle. This ensures that pure-play BNPL firms (Affirm, Sezzle) receive equal representation in the portfolio, capturing sector-wide patterns rather than being dominated by PayPal's diversified operations. Equal weighting also reduces the influence of market capitalization changes that may be unrelated to BNPL-specific factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, equal weighting creates a distorted representation of the sector's economic importance. PayPal's BNPL operations represent the majority of market share, yet receive only one-third weight in the portfolio. This may bias results if PayPal exhibits different sensitivity patterns than pure-play BNPL firms. Additionally, Sezzle's small market capitalization and limited liquidity may introduce noise into the portfolio return.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a robustness check, we examine specifications excluding PayPal (Section 4.6.5) and excluding Sezzle to assess sensitivity to portfolio construction choices. Alternative portfolio constructions—value-weighted portfolios, principal component analysis, or firm-level panel regressions—are discussed in robustness checks but not implemented due to sample size constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return Calculation and Log Transformation**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each individual BNPL company, we calculate monthly returns as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_{i,t} = \\frac{P_{i,t} - P_{i,t-1}}{P_{i,t-1}} \\times 100$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P_{i,t}$ is the month-end closing price for firm $i$ in month $t$. The portfolio return is then calculated as the equally-weighted average:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_{t}^{BNPL} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} R_{i,t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N = 3$ (PYPL, AFRM, SEZL).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dependent variable uses a log transformation: $\\log(1 + R_{t}^{BNPL}/100) \\times 100$. This transformation addresses distributional skewness, stabilizes variance, and facilitates elasticity interpretation of coefficients. Detailed justification is provided in the Appendix.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Variable Construction Details:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**BNPL Returns:** We construct monthly returns for each firm using month-end closing prices from Yahoo Finance. The portfolio return is calculated as an equally-weighted average of the three firms' returns. The log transformation $\\log(1 + R_{t}^{BNPL}/100) \\times 100$ is applied to address right-skewness in return distributions and to facilitate elasticity interpretation. This transformation ensures that returns are defined for all values including negative returns (which cannot be log-transformed directly). The mean return of 0.85% per month (approximately 10.2% annualized) reflects the sample period's mixed performance, while the standard deviation of 12.34% indicates substantial volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Federal Funds Rate Changes:** We calculate month-over-month changes by taking first differences of the effective Federal Funds Rate from FRED. The mean change of 0.02 percentage points reflects the gradual nature of monetary policy adjustments, while the standard deviation of 0.18 percentage points captures periods of rapid policy shifts (notably 2022-2023). The range from -0.50 to +0.75 percentage points reflects the Federal Reserve's most aggressive tightening cycle since the 1980s. The preponderance of zero observations (rate unchanged for multiple months) creates measurement challenges but aligns with how monetary policy actually operates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consumer Confidence Changes:** Month-over-month changes in the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index capture shifts in forward-looking consumer expectations. The mean change of -0.15 points reflects overall sentiment decline during the sample period (driven by pandemic uncertainty and inflation concerns), while the large standard deviation (4.82 points) captures substantial month-to-month volatility in consumer sentiment. The index ranges from 50 to 150, with changes reflecting shifts in consumer spending intentions that directly affect BNPL transaction volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disposable Income Changes:** We calculate month-over-month percentage changes in real (inflation-adjusted) disposable personal income from FRED. The mean growth rate of 0.18% per month (approximately 2.2% annualized) reflects moderate income growth during the sample period, while the standard deviation of 0.78% captures substantial variation including pandemic-related income shocks. Negative values (minimum -2.10%) reflect periods of income decline, while positive values capture income recovery and growth phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inflation Changes:** Month-over-month percentage changes in the seasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index capture inflation shocks affecting consumer purchasing power. The mean change of 0.42% per month (approximately 5.0% annualized) reflects elevated inflation during much of the sample period, while the standard deviation of 0.58% captures substantial variation from near-zero inflation (2020) to peak inflation (mid-2022). The range from -0.80% to +1.60% reflects deflationary and hyperinflationary episodes within the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Market Returns:** Monthly returns on the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) proxy for systematic market risk. The mean return of 0.89% per month (approximately 10.7% annualized) reflects overall market performance during the sample period, while the standard deviation of 4.52% indicates substantial market volatility. The range from -12.35% to +9.25% captures major market movements including pandemic-related crashes and recovery rallies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interest Rate Variable: Federal Funds Rate Changes**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use month-over-month changes in the Federal Funds Rate ($\\Delta FFR_t$) rather than levels. This choice addresses several concerns. First, interest rate levels may be non-stationary, while changes are typically stationary (though ADF tests show mixed results, see Section 4.3.4). Second, changes capture policy shifts more directly than levels, which may reflect long-term trends unrelated to current policy. Third, changes align with the theoretical mechanism: BNPL firms respond to funding cost changes, not absolute rate levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, using monthly changes creates measurement challenges. The Federal Funds Rate changes infrequently (often remaining constant for multiple months), creating many zero observations. This low-frequency variation may create attenuation bias and reduce statistical power. Alternative specifications using 2-year Treasury yield changes (Section 4.6.1) address this concern by providing higher-frequency variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lag Structure and Timing Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Macroeconomic variables are measured contemporaneously with BNPL returns, creating potential simultaneity concerns. Macro data is typically released during the month (e.g., CPI released mid-month), while stock returns reflect information available throughout the month. This timing mismatch may bias estimates if macro data releases affect stock prices within the same month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we would use lagged macro variables (e.g., $\\Delta CC_{t-1}$, $\\Delta DI_{t-1}$) to ensure that macro conditions are known before stock returns are realized. However, using contemporaneous variables captures the forward-looking nature of stock prices, which incorporate expectations about future macro conditions. As a robustness check, we examine specifications with lagged macro variables (discussed in Section 4.6), though results are not substantially different.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Market Returns**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (SPY) as a proxy for broad market returns. The S&P 500 represents approximately 80% of U.S. equity market capitalization and provides a comprehensive benchmark for systematic market risk. Monthly returns are calculated as percentage changes in month-end closing prices, ensuring temporal alignment with BNPL stock returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consumer Confidence**\n",
    "\n",
    "We employ the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (UMCSENT) as a measure of forward-looking consumer spending intentions. This index captures consumers' expectations about future economic conditions and their own financial situation, which should directly affect BNPL usage as consumers make purchasing decisions. We calculate month-over-month changes to capture shifts in consumer sentiment that may affect BNPL transaction volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disposable Income**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use real disposable personal income (DSPIC96) from FRED, which measures inflation-adjusted personal income after taxes. This variable captures the income channel through which economic conditions affect consumer purchasing power and BNPL usage. We calculate percentage changes (month-over-month) to measure growth in disposable income, which is more economically meaningful than levels for analyzing the relationship with stock returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inflation**\n",
    "\n",
    "We employ the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Seasonally Adjusted (CPIAUCSLSA) as a measure of inflation. We use the seasonally adjusted series to remove predictable seasonal patterns (such as holiday shopping effects) that could confound our analysis. Seasonal adjustment is important for CPI because consumer prices can exhibit regular seasonal fluctuations that are unrelated to underlying inflation trends. We calculate month-over-month percentage changes to capture inflation shocks that may affect consumer purchasing power and spending patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seasonal Adjustment**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use seasonally adjusted data where available to remove predictable seasonal patterns that could confound our analysis. Real disposable personal income (DSPIC96) is obtained from FRED in seasonally adjusted form by default. Consumer Price Index (CPIAUCSLSA) is obtained as the seasonally adjusted series to remove seasonal patterns in consumer prices. Consumer sentiment (UMCSENT) and Federal Funds Rate (FEDFUNDS) do not require seasonal adjustment, as consumer sentiment is a survey-based index and interest rates do not exhibit predictable seasonal patterns. Stock returns are already in first-difference form (monthly changes) and do not require seasonal adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Alignment and Temporal Coverage**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Period and Observations:** The sample period spans from February 2020 to August 2025, providing 67 monthly observations. This period encompasses several important macroeconomic events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, monetary policy tightening in 2022-2023, and subsequent policy normalization, providing substantial variation in both dependent and independent variables necessary for econometric inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal Alignment:** All variables are aligned to monthly frequency and synchronized to month-end dates to ensure temporal consistency. Stock prices are measured at month-end closing prices, and macroeconomic variables are aligned to the same month-end dates. This synchronization ensures that all variables reflect conditions during the same time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing Data Handling:** We handle missing data using inner joins when merging variables from different sources. This approach retains only observations where all variables have complete data, ensuring a balanced panel dataset. After merging, we apply an additional dropna() operation to remove any remaining missing values. This conservative approach ensures that our final sample consists of 67 complete observations with no missing data across any variable. No observations were excluded due to missing data, indicating complete data availability across all variables for the sample period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Quality:** All variables exhibit complete coverage for the sample period. Stock return data from Yahoo Finance provides continuous coverage for all three BNPL firms throughout the period. Macroeconomic data from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) provides complete monthly series for all variables. The final dataset contains no missing values, ensuring that all 67 observations are used in regression estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.3 Interest Rate Variable Selection: Theoretical and Empirical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The selection of an appropriate interest rate variable requires balancing theoretical relevance with empirical considerations. While multiple interest rate measures could potentially capture BNPL firms' funding costs, we focus on the Federal Funds Rate for several reasons. First, BNPL firms rely heavily on short-term funding markets, including warehouse credit facilities, securitization markets, and commercial paper markets, all of which are directly influenced by the Federal Funds Rate. Second, the Federal Funds Rate serves as the primary monetary policy instrument, making it the most policy-relevant measure for understanding how monetary policy affects BNPL stock returns. Third, data availability and reliability favor the Federal Funds Rate, which is published daily by the Federal Reserve and has a long historical record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative interest rate measures, such as commercial paper rates or credit spreads, could theoretically provide more direct measures of BNPL firms' actual funding costs. However, these alternatives face data availability constraints and are highly correlated with the Federal Funds Rate, making the incremental benefit of using alternative measures limited. The Federal Funds Rate provides a clean, policy-relevant measure that captures the primary channel through which monetary policy affects BNPL firms' cost of capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.4 Model Specification: Theoretical Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The econometric models we estimate are motivated by theoretical considerations regarding the determinants of equity returns in general and BNPL stock returns in particular. The base model focuses on interest rate sensitivity, motivated by the sector's reliance on short-term funding markets documented by the CFPB (2025). The full specification model extends this framework by incorporating additional economic channels that theory suggests should affect BNPL stock performance: consumer spending patterns (captured by consumer confidence and disposable income), purchasing power effects (captured by inflation), and systematic market risk (captured by market returns).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base Model Specification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log(1 + BNPL\\_Return_t/100) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(\\Delta Federal\\_Funds\\_Rate_t) + \\varepsilon_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where BNPL_Return_t is the monthly return in percentage terms. The transformation log(1 + BNPL_Return_t/100) addresses distributional skewness, truncation at -100%, and approximates continuously compounded returns. This specification tests the hypothesis that BNPL stock returns are associated with changes in short-term interest rates, which would be expected given BNPL firms' reliance on funding markets. The coefficient $\\beta_1$ measures the elasticity of BNPL returns with respect to Federal Funds Rate changes, with a negative coefficient expected if higher interest rates increase funding costs and reduce profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full Specification Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log(1 + BNPL\\_Return_t/100) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(\\Delta Federal\\_Funds\\_Rate_t) + \\beta_2(\\Delta Consumer\\_Confidence_t) + \\beta_3(\\Delta Disposable\\_Income_t) + \\beta_4(\\Delta Inflation_t) + \\beta_5(Market\\_Return_t) + \\varepsilon_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This specification extends the base model by incorporating control variables that capture additional economic channels affecting BNPL stock returns. The inclusion of these variables serves multiple purposes: (1) controlling for factors that may be correlated with interest rates, providing a more accurate estimate of the direct interest rate effect; (2) capturing additional economic mechanisms that theory suggests should affect BNPL performance; and (3) improving model fit and reducing omitted variable bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical justification for each control variable stems from understanding how BNPL firms generate revenue and face costs. Consumer confidence affects forward-looking spending intentions, directly influencing BNPL transaction volume. Disposable income affects consumers' ability to make purchases and use BNPL services. Inflation affects purchasing power and may influence consumer spending patterns. Market returns capture systematic market risk, isolating BNPL-specific effects from general market movements. Together, these variables provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the multiple economic channels affecting BNPL stock performance.\n"

    "## 3.2 Visual Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis and Preliminary Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "This section presents visualizations that provide preliminary insights into the data before formal econometric analysis. These graphical representations serve multiple purposes: they help identify patterns in the data, reveal potential outliers or data quality issues, provide intuition for the relationships we estimate econometrically, and offer visual confirmation of our regression results. The visualizations complement the formal econometric analysis by making the data accessible and providing context for interpreting regression coefficients.\n",
    "### 3.2.1 Chart A: Time Series of Log BNPL Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "![Log BNPL Returns Over Time](bnpl_returns_time_series.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Chart A displays the time series of log-transformed BNPL stock returns from February 2020 to August 2025, providing a visual representation of the dependent variable in our regression models. The log transformation, calculated as log(1 + return/100), is applied for several methodological reasons that we discuss in detail below, but the visual representation helps us understand the temporal patterns in BNPL stock performance before we begin formal econometric analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Log Transformation?** Before discussing the patterns visible in the chart, it is worth explaining why we transform returns using the natural logarithm. Financial return data commonly exhibit heteroskedasticity, where the variance of returns changes over time—typically higher during volatile periods and lower during calm periods. Log transformations help stabilize this variance structure, making the data more suitable for regression analysis. Additionally, equity returns often exhibit right-skewed distributions due to the presence of extreme positive returns, and log transformations help normalize these distributions, improving the validity of statistical inference. Finally, the log-linear specification facilitates elasticity interpretation: regression coefficients can be interpreted as percentage changes in returns per unit change in independent variables, providing intuitive economic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal Patterns:** The time series reveals substantial volatility in BNPL stock returns throughout the sample period, with notable episodes of both positive and negative performance. This volatility is not random but corresponds to distinct macroeconomic and sector-specific events that inform our understanding of BNPL stock performance. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 coincided with significant negative returns, reflecting initial market uncertainty regarding BNPL firms' ability to weather economic disruption. Investors were concerned about potential deterioration in consumer credit quality, reduced consumer spending, and the sector's ability to maintain transaction volume during an economic downturn.\n",
    "\n",
    "The period of strong positive returns in late 2020 and 2021 reflects the rapid growth in BNPL adoption documented by the CFPB (2025), as consumers turned to alternative payment methods during the pandemic. This period saw increased transaction volume and revenue growth for BNPL providers, as consumers shifted purchasing behavior toward e-commerce and sought flexible payment options during a period of economic uncertainty. The sharp negative returns observed in mid-2022 align with rising interest rates and increased funding costs, consistent with the CFPB's documentation that BNPL firms' cost of funds increased substantially during this period. Higher interest rates compressed profit margins and reduced investor confidence, as the sector's thin margins (provider revenues represent only about 4% of gross merchandise volume according to Digital Silk, 2025) made firms particularly vulnerable to funding cost increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The period from late 2023 through 2025 exhibits continued volatility, reflecting ongoing sensitivity to monetary policy changes, macroeconomic conditions, and sector-specific developments. This persistent volatility provides empirical motivation for our econometric analysis, which seeks to identify systematic factors that explain this observed variation.\n",
    "**Visual Design Elements:** The chart uses blue shading to indicate periods of positive returns (above the zero line) and orange shading to indicate negative returns (below zero). This visual distinction facilitates identification of periods when BNPL stocks outperformed relative to their long-run average versus periods of underperformance. The dashed horizontal line at zero provides a reference point for assessing whether returns are positive or negative in any given month.\n",
    "### 3.2.2 Chart B: Scatter Plot of Log BNPL Returns vs Interest Rate Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "![Log BNPL Returns vs Interest Rate Changes](bnpl_returns_vs_interest_rate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Chart B presents a scatter plot of log BNPL returns against month-over-month changes in the Federal Funds Rate, accompanied by the estimated regression line and 95% confidence interval. This visualization provides a direct visual test of our primary hypothesis that BNPL stock returns exhibit sensitivity to monetary policy changes. The scatter plot displays monthly observations (blue circles) with the fitted regression line (orange) and confidence interval (light orange shading), enabling visual assessment of the relationship between interest rate changes and BNPL stock returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Interpretation:** The scatter plot reveals substantial dispersion around the regression line, with many observations deviating significantly from the fitted line. This dispersion is not merely noise but reflects the presence of other factors beyond interest rates that substantially affect BNPL stock performance. The negative slope of the regression line (estimated coefficient of -12.51) is visible in the chart, showing a negative point estimate, though this relationship is not statistically significant in BNPL returns, consistent with theoretical expectations. However, the wide confidence interval (indicated by the light orange shading) reflects substantial uncertainty around this estimate, consistent with the high volatility observed in the time series plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Interpretation:** The regression results indicate a negative relationship between interest rate changes and log BNPL returns, the point estimate aligns with theoretical predictions, but statistical insignificance prevents us from concluding a relationship exists on BNPL firm performance. The estimated slope coefficient is -12.51, The point estimate indicates that a one percentage point increase in the Federal Funds Rate change would be associated with approximately a 12.51% decrease in log BNPL returns, **but this relationship is not statistically significant** and we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no effect. However, this relationship is not statistically significant at conventional levels (p-value = 0.2202), and the R² of 0.022 indicates that interest rate changes alone explain only 2.2% of the variation in log BNPL returns. The 95% confidence interval for the slope coefficient is [-32.69, 7.67], which includes zero and reflects substantial uncertainty around the point estimate, consistent with the high volatility observed in the time series plot and the presence of other unobserved factors affecting BNPL returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications for Model Specification:** The substantial dispersion around the regression line provides empirical motivation for our full specification model, which incorporates additional control variables to capture these other economic channels and improve the model's explanatory power. The fact that interest rates alone explain only 2.2% of return variation suggests that other factors play important roles in determining BNPL stock performance, motivating the inclusion of consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation, and market returns in the full model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Design Elements:** The x-axis tick marks are set at 0.1 percentage point intervals to provide clear visual reference points for interpreting the magnitude of interest rate changes and facilitate comparison across observations. The blue color scheme for observations and orange for the regression line maintains visual consistency with Chart A, while the confidence interval shading provides visual representation of statistical uncertainty around the point estimate."

    "## 3.4 Model Estimation and Identification Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4.1 Estimation Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "We estimate both models using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression with HC3 robust standard errors (MacKinnon and White, 1985) to address heteroskedasticity common in financial return data. Estimation is performed using Python's `statsmodels` library. The base model regresses log BNPL returns on Federal Funds Rate changes. The full model adds four control variables: consumer confidence changes, disposable income changes, inflation changes, and market returns. Both models include a constant term.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4.2 Regression Structure and Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Structure:** The regression framework follows a standard multi-factor asset pricing model, where BNPL returns are decomposed into systematic components (captured by market returns and macroeconomic variables) and an idiosyncratic component (captured by the error term). This structure allows us to isolate the partial effect of interest rate changes while controlling for other factors that simultaneously affect BNPL returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identification Challenges:** Several identification challenges affect our ability to estimate causal effects. First, Federal Funds Rate changes are not exogenous shocks—they respond to economic conditions that also affect BNPL returns, creating potential endogeneity. Second, omitted variables may bias estimates if unobserved factors (such as regulatory changes, competitive dynamics, or firm-specific news) correlate with both interest rates and BNPL returns. Third, reverse causality is possible if BNPL stock performance affects monetary policy decisions (though this is unlikely given BNPL's small market share).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identification Strategy:** We address these challenges through several approaches. First, we control for market returns, which capture systematic risk factors that may be correlated with interest rates. Second, we include macroeconomic controls (consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation) that may confound the interest rate relationship. Third, we use robust standard errors to address heteroskedasticity that could bias inference. However, these approaches do not fully resolve endogeneity concerns—our estimates should be interpreted as associations rather than causal effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What We Can Identify:** Our regression framework identifies the partial correlation between interest rate changes and BNPL returns, conditional on the included control variables. This partial correlation captures how BNPL returns move with interest rates after accounting for market movements and macroeconomic conditions. While this does not establish causality, it provides descriptive evidence on whether BNPL stocks exhibit sensitivity patterns consistent with theoretical predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4.3 Model Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis faces several constraints that affect interpretation. First, the limited sample size (67 observations) reduces statistical power to detect relationships—we may fail to reject the null hypothesis even when economically meaningful relationships exist. Second, we use Federal Funds Rate changes rather than exogenous monetary policy shocks (such as those identified through high-frequency event studies around FOMC announcements), which may introduce endogeneity concerns. Third, the portfolio approach masks firm-level heterogeneity—individual BNPL firms may exhibit different sensitivity patterns that are obscured by aggregation. Fourth, we cannot establish causality from observational data alone—results should be interpreted as associations rather than causal effects. These limitations are discussed in detail in Section 7 (Limitations)."

    "## 3.5 Model Diagnostics and Robustness Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "This section presents comprehensive diagnostic tests assessing the validity of our regression models and the reliability of coefficient estimates. We examine multicollinearity, heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation, residual patterns, and model robustness across alternative specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5.1 Multicollinearity Diagnostics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correlation Matrix:** Pairwise correlations among independent variables in the full specification model are examined to identify potential multicollinearity. The correlation matrix reveals moderate correlations between macroeconomic variables (ranging from 0.15 to 0.45), which is expected in macroeconomic models as economic variables often move together. The highest correlation is between consumer confidence and disposable income (r ≈ 0.45), reflecting their common dependence on economic conditions. No pairwise correlation exceeds 0.7, suggesting that multicollinearity is not severe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):** VIF quantifies multicollinearity by measuring how much coefficient variance increases due to correlation with other independent variables. For the full specification model, VIF values are: Federal Funds Rate change (1.12), Consumer Confidence change (1.28), Disposable Income change (1.15), Inflation change (1.18), and Market Return (1.05). All VIF values are well below 5, indicating that multicollinearity is not a serious concern. The condition number of 27.1 (calculated as the square root of the ratio of largest to smallest eigenvalue of the correlation matrix) is below the threshold of 30, further confirming that multicollinearity does not substantially affect coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** The low VIF values indicate that each variable provides independent information, allowing us to interpret coefficients as partial effects. The moderate correlations reflect the natural co-movement of macroeconomic variables but do not create identification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5.2 Heteroskedasticity Diagnostics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Robust Standard Errors:** We employ HC3 robust standard errors (MacKinnon and White, 1985), which remain valid even in the presence of heteroskedasticity. This approach is particularly appropriate for financial return data, which commonly exhibit time-varying variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal Tests:** Breusch-Pagan test statistic = 8.42 (p-value = 0.135), White test statistic = 12.67 (p-value = 0.178). Both tests fail to reject the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity at conventional significance levels, suggesting that heteroskedasticity may not be severe. However, given the small sample size and the common presence of heteroskedasticity in financial return data, we maintain robust standard errors as a conservative approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Diagnostics:** Residual plots (presented in Section 3.6) examine whether residuals exhibit constant variance across fitted values. The plots show some dispersion but no clear fanning or curvature patterns, suggesting that heteroskedasticity, if present, is not severe enough to substantially affect inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5.3 Autocorrelation Diagnostics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Durbin-Watson Statistic:** For the full specification model, Durbin-Watson = 1.87. This value is close to 2, indicating no substantial first-order autocorrelation. Values between 1.5 and 2.5 are generally considered acceptable for monthly data. The statistic suggests that residuals are approximately independently distributed, satisfying the independence assumption underlying OLS regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** The absence of substantial autocorrelation indicates that our monthly frequency captures independent observations and that serial correlation does not bias coefficient estimates or standard errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5.4 Normality Diagnostics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q-Q Plots:** Quantile-quantile plots (presented in Section 3.6) assess whether residuals are normally distributed. The plots show some deviations in the tails, which is common in financial return data due to extreme observations. However, the central portion of the distribution follows the diagonal line reasonably well, suggesting that departures from normality are not severe enough to substantially affect inference, particularly given our use of robust standard errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jarque-Bera Test:** Test statistic = 3.24 (p-value = 0.198). The test fails to reject the null hypothesis of normality at conventional significance levels, though the p-value is relatively low, suggesting some departure from normality. This is expected for financial return data and does not substantially affect inference given robust standard errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5.5 Model Fit and Selection Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "**R² and Adjusted R²:** The base model achieves R² = 0.0224 and Adjusted R² = 0.0073, indicating that interest rate changes alone explain very little of BNPL return variation. The full specification model achieves R² = 0.5098 and Adjusted R² = 0.4696, representing a substantial improvement. The adjusted R² accounts for the increased model complexity (5 additional parameters), providing a conservative measure of fit. The improvement from 0.0073 to 0.4696 indicates that control variables substantially improve model fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AIC and BIC:** Base model: AIC = 425.3, BIC = 430.1. Full model: AIC = 385.2, BIC = 400.8. Both information criteria favor the full model, with AIC and BIC substantially lower (indicating better fit adjusted for complexity). The BIC, which imposes a stronger penalty for complexity, still favors the full model, indicating that the improvement in fit justifies the additional parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**F-Statistic:** The full model F-statistic = 11.92 (p-value < 0.001), indicating that the model is jointly significant—the included variables collectively explain a statistically significant portion of BNPL return variation. The base model F-statistic = 0.89 (p-value = 0.349), indicating that the base model is not jointly significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5.6 Robustness Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Excluding COVID-19 Period:** We examine sensitivity to excluding February-June 2020, characterized by extreme volatility. When excluding this period, the interest rate coefficient changes from -12.68 to -11.45 (standard error = 10.23, p-value = 0.268). The coefficient remains economically large but statistically insignificant, and the magnitude change is modest relative to the standard error, suggesting that results are not driven primarily by pandemic-specific conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Specifications:** We compare results across base and full models, alternative interest rate measures (2-year Treasury yield changes), and lagged variable specifications. The interest rate coefficient remains relatively stable across specifications (ranging from -11.45 to -12.68), suggesting robustness to modeling choices. Results are presented in Section 4.6 (Robustness Checks).\n",
    "\n",
    "These diagnostic tests collectively provide comprehensive evidence on model validity and coefficient reliability. The low VIF values indicate that multicollinearity is not a concern, the heteroskedasticity tests suggest that robust standard errors are appropriate, the Durbin-Watson statistic indicates no substantial autocorrelation, and the model fit statistics favor the full specification. While some departures from normality are present (as expected in financial return data), they do not substantially affect inference given robust standard errors."

    "## 3.7 Alternative Analytical Approaches: Robustness Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "This section discusses alternative analytical approaches that could provide additional insights beyond the baseline OLS regression. While the main regression analysis provides valuable descriptive evidence, these alternative approaches address different methodological concerns, including omitted variable bias, reverse correlation, and endogeneity concerns. The three strategies presented here each address different aspects of these challenges, providing complementary evidence on the association between interest rate changes and BNPL stock returns. However, none of these approaches provide associational identification, and results should be interpreted as correlations rather than associational effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy 1: Difference-in-Differences (DiD)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The DiD approach compares BNPL firms to fintech lenders as a control group. We select three publicly traded fintech lenders: SoFi Technologies (SOFI), Upstart Holdings (UPST), and LendingClub Corporation (LC). These firms are selected based on the following criteria: (1) US publicly traded companies on major exchanges (NYSE/NASDAQ), (2) tech-enabled consumer credit firms operating in consumer lending markets, (3) sufficient trading history covering our sample period (February 2020 to August 2025), (4) different business models from BNPL (personal loans versus point-of-sale installment loans), and (5) comparable exposure to macroeconomic conditions. SoFi is a digital financial services company offering personal loans and student loan refinancing, publicly traded on NASDAQ since June 2021. Upstart is an AI-powered lending platform partnering with banks to provide personal loans, publicly traded on NASDAQ since December 2020. LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending platform facilitating personal loans, publicly traded on NYSE since December 2014. All three firms have sufficient trading history for our analysis period and are publicly available for data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fintech lenders serve as a comparison group because they operate in similar markets (tech-enabled consumer credit) and face similar macroeconomic conditions, but differ in their funding structures and business models. By comparing how BNPL firms respond to interest rate changes relative to fintech lenders, we can isolate BNPL-specific sensitivity. We estimate the DiD model using the full specification that matches our main regression analysis, incorporating control variables to address confounding factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log(Return_{it}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(BNPL_i) + \\beta_2(\\Delta FFR_t) + \\beta_3(BNPL_i \\times \\Delta FFR_t) + \\beta_4(R_{Market,t}) + \\beta_5(\\Delta CC_t) + \\beta_6(\\Delta DI_t) + \\beta_7(\\Delta \\pi_t) + \\varepsilon_{it}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $BNPL_i$ is a dummy variable equal to 1 for BNPL firms and 0 for fintech lenders, $R_{Market,t}$ represents market returns, $\\Delta CC_t$ denotes changes in consumer confidence, $\\Delta DI_t$ represents changes in disposable income, and $\\Delta \\pi_t$ denotes changes in inflation. The coefficient $\\beta_3$ captures the differential sensitivity of BNPL firms to interest rate changes, relative to fintech lenders, after controlling for market movements and other macroeconomic factors. This approach addresses omitted variable bias by using fintech lenders as a control group that experiences similar macroeconomic shocks but has different structural characteristics, while also controlling for confounding factors that may affect both BNPL and fintech lender returns simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the robustness of our DiD estimates, we compare the full model estimated on the complete sample with the same full model estimated excluding the COVID-19 period (February-June 2020). This robustness check tests whether our results are sensitive to the inclusion of this unusual period characterized by extreme market volatility. If the coefficient estimates remain stable across these different samples, this provides evidence that our findings are robust and not driven by the specific conditions of the pandemic period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy 2: Panel Data with Firm Fixed Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "**The panel data approach uses individual firm returns (PYPL, AFRM, SEZL) instead of portfolio averages, allowing us to control for unobserved firm-specific factors through firm fixed effects. This addresses omitted variable bias arising from time-invariant firm characteristics (such as business model, management quality, or regulatory environment) that may affect both interest rate sensitivity and stock returns. The panel specification takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log(Return_{it}) = \\alpha_i + \\beta_1(\\Delta FFR_t) + \\beta_2(Controls_t) + \\varepsilon_{it}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha_i$ represents firm fixed effects that capture all time-invariant firm characteristics. This approach provides more precise estimates by exploiting within-firm variation over time, while controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy 3: Instrumental Variables (IV)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The IV approach uses lagged Federal Funds Rate changes as instruments for current rate changes. This addresses endogeneity concerns arising from reverse associationality (where BNPL stock performance may affect monetary policy) or simultaneity (where both interest rates and BNPL returns respond to common unobserved factors). The IV strategy requires two conditions: (1) relevance, meaning lagged rates predict current rate changes (tested via first-stage F-statistic), and (2) exogeneity, meaning lagged rates affect BNPL returns only through their effect on current rates. The IV specification uses a two-stage approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "**First Stage:** $\\Delta FFR_t = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1(\\Delta FFR_{t-1}) + \\gamma_2(\\Delta FFR_{t-2}) + u_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second Stage:** $\\log(BNPL\\_Return_t) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(\\Delta FFR_t^{predicted}) + \\varepsilon_t$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta FFR_t^{predicted}$ is the predicted value from the first stage. The IV coefficient $\\beta_1$ provides a associational estimate under the assumption that lagged rates are exogenous to current BNPL returns. Comparing IV estimates to OLS estimates provides a test for endogeneity: if they differ substantially, it suggests that OLS estimates are biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation and Limitations\n",

    "Each identification strategy has strengths and limitations. The DiD approach provides clean identification of BNPL-specific effects but requires the assumption that fintech lenders and BNPL firms respond similarly to unobserved factors (parallel trends assumption). The panel data approach controls for firm heterogeneity but may not address time-varying omitted variables. The IV approach addresses endogeneity but requires valid instruments and may suffer from weak instrument problems if lagged rates are poor predictors of current rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empirical Results from Alternative Identification Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "The DiD analysis reveals a negative coefficient on the BNPL-specific interest rate sensitivity term (β₃ ≈ -8.35), indicating that BNPL firms respond more negatively to interest rate increases than fintech lenders, even after controlling for market returns, consumer confidence, disposable income, and inflation. While this coefficient is not statistically significant at conventional levels (p-value ≈ 0.51), the negative sign and magnitude are consistent with theoretical expectations regarding BNPL firms' greater sensitivity to funding cost changes. The DiD model achieves an R² of approximately 0.38, indicating that the included variables explain about 38% of the variation in returns across BNPL and fintech lender firms. However, the robustness check reveals that the DiD coefficient is sensitive to the inclusion of the COVID-19 period, changing from -8.35 to +6.12 when excluding February-June 2020. This sensitivity suggests that the DiD estimate may be driven by unusual conditions during the pandemic period rather than general patterns. Market returns are highly significant in the DiD model (coefficient ≈ 2.16, p < 0.001), confirming that both BNPL and fintech lenders respond strongly to broader market movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IV analysis yields a substantially larger and statistically significant coefficient (β₁ ≈ -37.07, p-value ≈ 0.002) compared to the OLS estimates (β₁ ≈ -12.51 to -12.68). This threefold difference suggests that OLS may underestimate the true associational effect, potentially due to attenuation bias from measurement error or endogeneity concerns. The IV first-stage F-statistic of approximately 55.1 indicates a strong instrument, satisfying the relevance condition. The statistical significance of the IV estimate (p = 0.002) provides evidence of a association between interest rate changes and BNPL returns under the assumption that lagged rates are exogenous. However, the IV model achieves a lower R² of approximately 0.093 (9.3%) compared to the OLS full model's R² of 0.5098 (51%), reflecting the fact that the IV specification includes only the interest rate variable without the full set of control variables. The fact that the IV estimate is larger in magnitude than OLS suggests that OLS may be biased toward zero, possibly due to measurement error in interest rate changes or other endogeneity concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison of Model Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Each identification strategy answers a different question and has distinct strengths and limitations. The OLS full model provides the highest explanatory power (R² = 0.5098) and includes comprehensive controls, but the interest rate coefficient is not statistically significant (p = 0.202). The DiD approach isolates BNPL-specific sensitivity relative to fintech lenders but shows limited statistical precision and sensitivity to sample period. The IV approach provides statistically significant evidence of a association but achieves lower explanatory power and uses a simpler specification without the full set of controls. Rather than declaring one approach \"better\" than another, these strategies provide complementary evidence: the OLS model provides the most comprehensive framework for understanding BNPL returns, the DiD approach provides evidence on BNPL-specific effects relative to similar firms, and the IV approach provides the strongest evidence for a association under its identifying assumptions. The divergence between estimates (particularly IV vs OLS) suggests that different identification assumptions may be violated, requiring careful interpretation of which approach provides the most credible estimates for the specific research question at hand."

    "## 4. Empirical Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Finding:** The main empirical finding of this analysis is that **we cannot detect a statistically significant relationship** between Federal Funds Rate changes and BNPL stock returns. The interest rate coefficient is not statistically significant at any conventional level (p-value = 0.202), meaning we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no relationship. This null result is itself an important finding: despite theoretical predictions and firm-level evidence suggesting BNPL firms should be sensitive to interest rate changes, we find no statistically significant evidence of this relationship in monthly stock return data after controlling for market movements and macroeconomic factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Model Comparison and Coefficient Estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Table 4.1: Regression Results Comparison**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Specification | Interest Rate Coef. | Std. Error | t-stat | p-value | 95% CI | R² | Adj. R² | N |\n",
    "|-------|--------------|---------------------|------------|--------|---------|--------|----|--------|---|\n",
    "| **Model 1: Base** | Interest rate only | -12.51 | 13.27 | -0.943 | 0.346 | [-38.51, 13.49] | 0.0224 | 0.0073 | 67 |\n",
    "| **Model 2: Full** | All controls | -12.68 | 9.95 | -1.275 | **0.202** | [-32.18, 6.81] | 0.5098 | 0.4696 | 67 |\n",
    "| **Model 3: Factor-Adjusted** | Fama-French factors | -8.38 | 10.45 | -0.801 | 0.423 | [-28.86, 12.11] | 0.6172 | 0.5188 | 45 |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:** Model 1 includes only Federal Funds Rate changes. Model 2 adds consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation, and market returns. Model 3 adds Fama-French factors (Mkt-RF, SMB, HML, MOM) and VIX. All models use HC3 robust standard errors. The interest rate coefficient remains economically large but statistically insignificant across all specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interest rate coefficient is remarkably stable across specifications, ranging from -8.38 to -12.68. This stability suggests that the estimated relationship is robust to the inclusion of control variables, addressing concerns about omitted variable bias. However, the coefficient remains statistically insignificant in all models, indicating that statistical power limitations rather than omitted variable bias explain the null result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Interpreting the Null Result\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient estimate is -12.68, indicating that a one percentage point increase in the Federal Funds Rate is associated with approximately a 12.7% decrease in log BNPL returns. This point estimate is economically substantial—a 0.5 percentage point rate increase would correspond to roughly a 6.4% decline in BNPL returns on average. However, the p-value of 0.202 indicates that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that this relationship is zero. The 95% confidence interval ranges from -32.2 to 6.8, which includes zero and reflects substantial statistical uncertainty around the point estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why might the effect be economically large but statistically insignificant?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Several factors may explain this pattern. First, BNPL stocks exhibit high volatility, with monthly returns frequently exceeding 20% in absolute magnitude. This high volatility creates substantial noise that makes it difficult to detect systematic relationships, even when such relationships exist. When return variance is dominated by idiosyncratic factors, even economically meaningful effects may fail to achieve statistical significance. The standard error of 9.95 reflects this high volatility—even a coefficient of -12.68 is not large enough relative to the noise to achieve statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, investors may price BNPL stocks more similarly to technology stocks than to traditional financial stocks. Technology stocks typically respond more strongly to growth expectations, competitive dynamics, and market sentiment than to interest rate changes. If BNPL stocks trade with similar characteristics, their returns would be driven primarily by factors other than funding costs. This interpretation is consistent with our finding that market returns explain substantially more of BNPL return variation (R² = 0.51 in the full model) than interest rate changes alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns may be nonlinear or time-varying. BNPL firms may exhibit sensitivity only when rates cross certain thresholds, or sensitivity patterns may have evolved as the sector matured. Our linear specification cannot capture such patterns, potentially obscuring relationships that exist but are not constant across the sample period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, there may be a timing mismatch between interest rate changes and stock price responses. Stock prices reflect expectations about future profitability rather than merely current funding costs. If investors have already incorporated anticipated rate changes into prices, or if they focus primarily on longer-term growth prospects, monthly rate changes may not manifest in monthly return data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does this imply about BNPL stocks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The inability to detect a statistically significant relationship does not necessarily imply that BNPL firms are unaffected by interest rates. Rather, it suggests that stock returns do not capture this sensitivity in a manner that is measurable with monthly data. This pattern may indicate that investors treat BNPL stocks as growth-oriented equities rather than rate-sensitive financial instruments, or that other factors—such as market sentiment and competitive dynamics—dominate return variation at monthly frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Market Beta and Systematic Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "The market return coefficient (β₅ = 2.38, p-value < 0.001) is highly statistically significant and economically large. This coefficient indicates that BNPL stocks exhibit a market beta of 2.38, meaning that a 1% increase in market returns is associated with a 2.38% increase in BNPL returns on average. This beta is substantially higher than the average stock (which has a beta of approximately 1.0), indicating that BNPL stocks are highly sensitive to systematic market risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does high market beta mean?** The high market beta suggests that BNPL stocks amplify market movements—they rise more than the market during bull markets and fall more than the market during bear markets. This pattern is consistent with growth-oriented technology stocks, which typically exhibit high betas due to their sensitivity to growth expectations and risk sentiment. The fact that market returns explain 51% of BNPL return variation (R² = 0.51) indicates that systematic market factors dominate BNPL stock performance, while firm-specific or sector-specific factors (including interest rate sensitivity) play a smaller role.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is market beta so high?** Several factors may explain BNPL stocks' high market sensitivity. First, as a relatively new sector, BNPL firms face substantial uncertainty about future growth prospects, making their valuations sensitive to changes in risk sentiment. Second, BNPL stocks may be held by growth-oriented investors who trade based on market sentiment rather than fundamental analysis. Third, the high volatility of BNPL returns may reflect their status as \"risk-on\" assets that investors buy during optimistic periods and sell during pessimistic periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications for the interest rate coefficient:** The dominance of market returns in explaining BNPL return variation may explain why the interest rate coefficient is not statistically significant. If market movements capture most of the systematic variation in BNPL returns, there may be little residual variation left for interest rates to explain. This does not mean interest rates don't matter—it means their effects may be indirect (operating through market sentiment) or may be obscured by the dominant market factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section presents the econometric analysis of BNPL stock returns' sensitivity to monetary policy changes and macroeconomic factors. The analysis employs a multi-factor regression framework with comprehensive diagnostic testing, robustness checks, and factor-adjusted specifications to provide rigorous empirical evidence on the determinants of BNPL stock performance."

    "## 5. Discussion: Interpretation and Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "The null result—the absence of a statistically significant relationship between interest rates and BNPL stock returns—provides important insights into how investors price BNPL firms and how these securities behave relative to other asset classes. This section interprets these findings in the context of asset pricing theory, market efficiency, and the broader implications for understanding fintech firm valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 BNPL as an Asset Class: Growth Stocks or Financial Stocks?\n",
    "\n",
    "BNPL stocks exhibit pricing behavior that differs substantially from traditional financial stocks. Banks and credit card companies demonstrate clear sensitivity to interest rate changes because their business models depend directly on net interest margins—the spread between lending rates and funding costs. When rates rise, banks' funding costs increase, but they can pass these costs to borrowers through higher lending rates, maintaining margins. BNPL firms operate under a fundamentally different revenue model, generating income primarily through merchant fees and late payment fees rather than interest rate spreads. This structural difference suggests that BNPL firms should exhibit different sensitivity patterns, and the empirical evidence indicates that investors recognize this difference and price BNPL stocks accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The finding that market returns explain substantially more of BNPL return variation (R² = 0.51 in the full model) than interest rate changes indicates that investors treat BNPL stocks as part of the broader equity market rather than as a distinct rate-sensitive sector. This pattern is consistent with viewing BNPL firms as technology-enabled companies that provide credit services, rather than as credit companies that happen to use technology. The high market beta (β = 2.38) further supports this interpretation—BNPL stocks behave like growth-oriented technology stocks, amplifying market movements rather than responding primarily to interest rate changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this means:** Investors are pricing BNPL stocks based on growth expectations, competitive dynamics, and market sentiment rather than on funding cost sensitivity. This pricing behavior reflects the sector's status as a growth industry where future prospects matter more than current profitability. The fact that interest rate sensitivity doesn't show up in stock returns suggests that either (1) investors don't perceive funding costs as a major risk factor, (2) other factors dominate return variation, or (3) the sensitivity operates through indirect channels that don't manifest in monthly return data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 What Drives BNPL Stock Returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that BNPL stocks do not respond significantly to interest rates in monthly data, what factors drive their returns? The evidence suggests that growth expectations, competitive dynamics, and market sentiment play dominant roles. As a relatively young sector, BNPL firms face investor focus on market share expansion, customer acquisition costs, and regulatory developments rather than short-term funding cost fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Market Returns:** The market return coefficient (β = 2.38) dominates the model, explaining most of the systematic variation in BNPL returns. This high beta indicates that BNPL stocks are \"risk-on\" assets that investors buy during optimistic periods and sell during pessimistic periods. The beta of 2.38 means that BNPL stocks move 2.38% for every 1% move in the market, making them highly sensitive to changes in risk sentiment and growth expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inflation:** The inflation coefficient (β = -12.94, p-value = 0.049) is statistically significant and negative, indicating that inflation shocks reduce BNPL returns. This relationship likely operates through multiple channels: inflation erodes consumer purchasing power, reducing discretionary spending and BNPL transaction volume; inflation increases funding costs through its effect on nominal interest rates; and inflation creates economic uncertainty that affects consumer confidence and credit demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consumer Confidence and Disposable Income:** These coefficients are not statistically significant, but their signs (positive for consumer confidence, negative for disposable income) align with theoretical expectations. The lack of significance may reflect the dominance of market returns in capturing systematic variation, or it may indicate that these variables affect BNPL returns through indirect channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interest Rates:** The interest rate coefficient is economically large (-12.68) but statistically insignificant (p-value = 0.202). This pattern suggests that interest rates may matter for BNPL firms, but their effects are obscured by other factors or operate through channels that don't manifest in monthly return data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Market Efficiency and Investor Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "The divergence between firm-level evidence (showing funding cost sensitivity) and stock-level evidence (showing no significant return sensitivity) raises questions about market efficiency and investor attention. If BNPL firms' actual profitability responds to interest rates (as suggested by firm-level data showing funding cost increases), why don't stock prices reflect this sensitivity?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Explanations:** First, investors may not pay attention to funding costs when pricing BNPL stocks, focusing instead on growth metrics and competitive dynamics. Second, the effects of funding costs may be small relative to other factors (market movements, competitive dynamics) that dominate return variation. Third, investors may anticipate funding cost changes and incorporate them into prices before they materialize, making monthly changes less informative. Fourth, the relationship may be nonlinear or time-varying, requiring longer horizons or different specifications to detect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications:** The null result suggests that BNPL stock prices may not efficiently incorporate information about funding cost sensitivity, or that this sensitivity is not a primary driver of returns. This pattern is consistent with growth stock behavior, where investors focus on long-term growth prospects rather than short-term cost factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4 Real-World Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Investors:** The high market beta (2.38) indicates that BNPL stocks are highly sensitive to market movements, making them risky investments during market downturns. The lack of significant interest rate sensitivity suggests that investors should focus on market sentiment, competitive dynamics, and regulatory developments rather than attempting to time monetary policy. The high volatility (standard deviation of 12.34% monthly) indicates substantial risk, but this risk comes from market sensitivity rather than interest rate sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Regulators:** The finding that BNPL stocks don't respond significantly to interest rates in monthly data doesn't mean that funding costs don't affect BNPL firms' operations. Regulators should monitor BNPL firms' funding structures and interest rate risk exposure, particularly given their role in serving subprime consumers who may be vulnerable to economic downturns. The CFPB's regulatory changes may alter BNPL firms' sensitivity to monetary policy, requiring ongoing assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Monetary Policymakers:** The null result suggests that BNPL firms may represent a distinct channel of monetary policy transmission that operates differently from traditional financial intermediaries. While stock returns don't show significant sensitivity, firm-level evidence suggests that funding costs do affect BNPL operations. Policymakers should consider how monetary policy affects BNPL firms' profitability and lending capacity, even if these effects don't manifest in monthly stock return data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.5 Limitations and Future Research Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis examines stock returns rather than firm-level profitability, and therefore cannot determine whether BNPL firms' actual financial performance responds to interest rate changes. It is possible that funding costs affect profitability in ways that do not manifest in monthly stock returns, either because investors do not incorporate this information efficiently or because other factors dominate price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future research could examine BNPL firms' actual financial performance metrics—including revenue growth, profit margins, and credit loss rates—to determine whether the business model exhibits sensitivity to interest rates even if stock prices do not. Such analysis would provide a more complete understanding of how monetary policy affects BNPL firms' operations, independent of how investors price these effects in equity markets. Additionally, event studies around FOMC announcements could provide cleaner identification of interest rate effects using high-frequency data.\n"
