Before proceeding, I define what I mean by “interest-rate sensitivity” in the context of BNPL firms: the responsiveness of BNPL firms’ stock returns, profitability, and business operations to changes in benchmark interest rates (specifically, the Federal Funds Rate) that affect their cost of capital through wholesale funding markets. This sensitivity operates primarily through three channels: (1) direct funding cost pass-through, where increases in benchmark rates raise BNPL providers’ borrowing costs from warehouse facilities, securitization markets, and commercial paper markets; (2) competitive substitution effects, where higher interest rates on credit cards and personal loans increase consumer demand for BNPL products; and (3) capital market access, where rising rates affect investor expectations and BNPL firms’ ability to raise capital. This definition distinguishes BNPL interest-rate sensitivity from traditional consumer credit products, recognizing that many BNPL products are interest-free for consumers (if paid on time) and funded primarily through merchant fees and provider borrowing costs rather than consumer interest charges.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"key":"nyokI62Qss"}],"key":"GaHwGHxRS7"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The literature spans multiple dimensions: consumer spending patterns, credit market dynamics, firm-level funding structures, and interest rate transmission mechanisms.

For this analysis, I rely on the CFPB’s characterization (subprime borrowers with high utilization) for three reasons: (1) the CFPB uses comprehensive credit bureau data covering all major BNPL providers, (2) their sample is more recent (2022-2023), and (3) subprime borrower characteristics are more consistent with the high default rates documented across multiple sources.

They document that individuals allocate only 51.5% of their excess payments to the high APR card, behavior that is virtually indistinguishable from a completely non-responsive baseline (50%). To minimize interest charges, individuals should allocate 97.1% of excess payments to the high APR card, yet only 10% of individuals put 100% of their excess payments on the high interest rate card (when 85% should do so). Critically, the degree of misallocation is invariant to the difference in interest rates across cards (which can be as large as 15 percentage points), the size of the repayment amount, and the time since account opening, suggesting that optimization frictions or learning cannot explain the observed behavior. Instead, Gathergood et al. find that balance matching—whereby the share of repayments on each card matches the share of balances on each card—captures more than half of the predictable variation in repayment behavior and is the best fit model for roughly half of observations. This behavioral pattern has implications for understanding BNPL loan stacking behavior. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau documents that 63% of BNPL borrowers originated multiple simultaneous loans in 2022, and 33% held loans across multiple BNPL providers (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, “Consumer Use”). The balance-matching behavior documented by Gathergood et al. suggests that consumers facing multiple debt obligations may be vulnerable to broader economic shocks that affect their ability to manage repayments.","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":1},"end":{"line":17,"column":1}},"key":"ToiVEI9PSW"}],"key":"xzvhwHRR8B"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":1},"end":{"line":19,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Bian, Cong, and Ji (2023) analyze BNPL’s role in payment competition and credit expansion using transaction data from e-commerce platforms.

However, the literature reveals a notable contradiction regarding BNPL users’ credit profiles that warrants critical examination. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Consumer Use Report (2023) analyzes the demographic and credit profile of BNPL borrowers.

This finding contradicts Di Maggio et al.'s (2022) finding that BNPL usage is concentrated among consumers with moderate to high credit scores (680-740). This contradiction reflects several factors: different data sources (transaction-level provider data versus credit bureau data), different time periods, or different definitions of BNPL users (first-time users versus repeat users).

Laudenbach et al. (2025) find that BNPL firms’ funding costs increase by approximately 0.8-1.0 percentage points for each percentage point increase in benchmark interest rates. This indicates near-complete pass-through of monetary policy changes to funding costs. Affirm’s 10-K filings provide firm-level evidence of this mechanism: according to Affirm’s filings, funding costs increased dramatically during the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle (see Appendix A.1 for detailed analysis). Combined with thin profit margins (approximately 1% net transaction margins per CFPB Market Trends Report) and high leverage, these findings indicate that interest rate increases compress profit margins and reduce profitability. This should be reflected in negative stock returns. This theoretical framework motivates my primary hypothesis: BNPL stock returns respond negatively to Federal Funds Rate increases, after controlling for market movements and other macroeconomic factors.","position":{"start":{"line":140,"column":1},"end":{"line":140,"column":1}},"key":"LZDRlEkxrX"}],"key":"xPwNIswpMM"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":142,"column":1},"end":{"line":142,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"strong","position":{"start":{"line":142,"column":1},"end":{"line":142,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Consumer Confidence Channel:","position":{"start":{"line":142,"column":1},"end":{"line":142,"column":1}},"key":"DaluuaLM29"}],"key":"uUfmosMYKF"},{"type":"text","value":" The literature shows strong relationships between consumer sentiment and BNPL demand.

Di Maggio, Williams, and Katz (2022) find that BNPL access increases spending by approximately $130 per week, with spending remaining elevated for 24 weeks. This indicates that consumer spending patterns directly affect BNPL revenue streams. These findings motivate including consumer confidence measures in my regression analysis.

However, standard asset pricing theory, particularly the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and multi-factor models, suggests that BNPL stock returns should be correlated with market returns through systematic risk factors. The high market beta observed in my regression results (β₅ = 2.38) confirms this theoretical prediction. Inflation may affect BNPL firms through multiple channels: its impact on consumer purchasing power reduces discretionary spending capacity, its effect on funding costs increases the cost of capital, and its influence on economic uncertainty affects consumer confidence and credit demand.

The log transformation addresses heteroskedasticity and distributional skewness common in financial return data, while facilitating elasticity interpretation that is standard in financial econometrics. I employ a two-stage approach that follows established practices in monetary policy transmission research. I begin with a parsimonious base specification that examines the relationship between BNPL returns and interest rate changes, providing a benchmark estimate of interest rate sensitivity. I then estimate a full specification model that incorporates consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation, and market returns as control variables. This sequential estimation strategy serves multiple purposes: it allows me to assess both direct effects of monetary policy on BNPL stock performance and the incremental explanatory power of including additional control variables, it tests the theoretical mechanisms identified in the literature review above, and it enables me to examine the robustness of the interest rate coefficient to the inclusion of control variables, addressing concerns about omitted variable bias.","position":{"start":{"line":148,"column":1},"end":{"line":148,"column":1}},"key":"WCpB1uD8yT"}],"key":"aBpc37A3gx"}],"data":{"part":"literature"},"key":"cM9BrvyXfQ"},{"type":"block","position":{"start":{"line":151,"column":1},"end":{"line":151,"column":1}},"children":[],"key":"fNN7DcOXQa"}],"key":"OgoMwXPldP"},"references":{"cite":{"order":[],"data":{}}},"footer":{"navigation":{"prev":{"title":"1.
