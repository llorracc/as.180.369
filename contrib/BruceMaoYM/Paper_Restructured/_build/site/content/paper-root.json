The analysis spans February 2020 to August 2025, comprising 67 monthly observations that capture the rapid growth phase of the BNPL industry alongside significant monetary policy shifts from near-zero rates to approximately 5%.

However, this coefficient is economically large but statistically indistinguishable from zero (p-value = 0.202), indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no relationship. The full specification model achieves an R² of 0.5098, indicating that the included variables collectively explain approximately 51% of the variation in log BNPL returns. Market returns (β₅ = 2.38, p < 0.001) and inflation (β₄ = -12.94, p = 0.049) are the dominant statistically significant determinants, while the Federal Funds Rate coefficient, though large in magnitude, does not achieve statistical significance.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reports that BNPL Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) grew from USD 2 billion in 2019 to USD 24.2 billion in 2021, while unit margins declined from 1.27% in 2020 to 1.01% in 2021—a 20% compression in a single year. This combination of extreme growth and falling margins is exactly why we care about interest rate pass-through: even small increases in funding costs can eliminate already-thin profit margins, making BNPL firms particularly vulnerable to monetary policy changes.

Approximately 63% of BNPL borrowers originated multiple simultaneous loans in 2022, and 33% held loans across multiple BNPL providers. This customer base—financially constrained consumers with high debt burdens and loan stacking behavior—suggests BNPL firms are vulnerable to economic shocks.

Before proceeding, I define what I mean by “interest-rate sensitivity” in the context of BNPL firms: the responsiveness of BNPL firms’ stock returns, profitability, and business operations to changes in benchmark interest rates (specifically, the Federal Funds Rate) that affect their cost of capital through wholesale funding markets. This sensitivity operates primarily through three channels: (1) direct funding cost pass-through, where increases in benchmark rates raise BNPL providers’ borrowing costs from warehouse facilities, securitization markets, and commercial paper markets; (2) competitive substitution effects, where higher interest rates on credit cards and personal loans increase consumer demand for BNPL products; and (3) capital market access, where rising rates affect investor expectations and BNPL firms’ ability to raise capital. This definition distinguishes BNPL interest-rate sensitivity from traditional consumer credit products, recognizing that many BNPL products are interest-free for consumers (if paid on time) and funded primarily through merchant fees and provider borrowing costs rather than consumer interest charges.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"key":"cuPRpOBC5Q"}],"key":"f4POS8FMUI"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The literature spans multiple dimensions: consumer spending patterns, credit market dynamics, firm-level funding structures, and interest rate transmission mechanisms.

For this analysis, I rely on the CFPB’s characterization (subprime borrowers with high utilization) for three reasons: (1) the CFPB uses comprehensive credit bureau data covering all major BNPL providers, (2) their sample is more recent (2022-2023), and (3) subprime borrower characteristics are more consistent with the high default rates documented across multiple sources.

(2019) examine how consumers manage multiple debt obligations using data on 1.4 million individuals in the United Kingdom over a two-year period. They document that individuals allocate only 51.5% of their excess payments to the high APR card, behavior that is virtually indistinguishable from a completely non-responsive baseline (50%). To minimize interest charges, individuals should allocate 97.1% of excess payments to the high APR card, yet only 10% of individuals put 100% of their excess payments on the high interest rate card (when 85% should do so). Critically, the degree of misallocation is invariant to the difference in interest rates across cards (which can be as large as 15 percentage points), the size of the repayment amount, and the time since account opening, suggesting that optimization frictions or learning cannot explain the observed behavior. Instead, Gathergood et al. find that balance matching—whereby the share of repayments on each card matches the share of balances on each card—captures more than half of the predictable variation in repayment behavior and is the best fit model for roughly half of observations. This behavioral pattern has implications for understanding BNPL loan stacking behavior. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau documents that 63% of BNPL borrowers originated multiple simultaneous loans in 2022, and 33% held loans across multiple BNPL providers (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, “Consumer Use”). The balance-matching behavior documented by Gathergood et al. suggests that consumers facing multiple debt obligations may be vulnerable to broader economic shocks that affect their ability to manage repayments.","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":1},"end":{"line":17,"column":1}},"key":"X6adNiHhIv"}],"key":"z3PtlADHOl"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":1},"end":{"line":19,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Bian, Cong, and Ji (2023) analyze BNPL’s role in payment competition and credit expansion using transaction data from e-commerce platforms.

However, the literature reveals a notable contradiction regarding BNPL users’ credit profiles that warrants critical examination. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Consumer Use Report (2023) analyzes the demographic and credit profile of BNPL borrowers. The report finds that BNPL borrowers have subprime credit scores (580-669) compared to non-users (670-739). This indicates that BNPL serves consumers with lower credit quality. This finding contradicts Di Maggio et al.'s (2022) finding that BNPL usage is concentrated among consumers with moderate to high credit scores (680-740). This contradiction reflects several factors: different data sources (transaction-level provider data versus credit bureau data), different time periods, or different definitions of BNPL users (first-time users versus repeat users). The CFPB report’s use of credit bureau data may capture a broader population of BNPL users, including those who use BNPL infrequently or have limited credit histories, while Di Maggio et al.'s transaction-level data may focus on more active BNPL users.

The extent and nature of these relationships are the focus of this analysis.","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"CEl1hVLGnE"}],"key":"BUtSVM6Msr"}],"key":"HVo5CUdT42"},{"type":"block","kind":"notebook-content","children":[{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1},"end":{"line":1,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"3.1 Data Construction and Variable Selection","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1},"end":{"line":1,"column":1}},"key":"kdMOm1hcjL"}],"identifier":"id-3-1-data-construction-and-variable-selection","label":"3.1 Data Construction and Variable Selection","html_id":"id-3-1-data-construction-and-variable-selection","implicit":true,"key":"mFkaxlUpjD"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1},"end":{"line":3,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This section describes the data construction process and the rationale for variable selection in our econometric models.

Financial return data commonly exhibit heteroskedasticity, where the variance of returns changes over time—typically higher during volatile periods and lower during calm periods. Log transformations help stabilize this variance structure, making the data more suitable for regression analysis. Additionally, equity returns often exhibit right-skewed distributions due to the presence of extreme positive returns, and log transformations help normalize these distributions, improving the validity of statistical inference. Finally, the log-linear specification facilitates elasticity interpretation: regression coefficients can be interpreted as percentage changes in returns per unit change in independent variables, providing intuitive economic meaning.","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":1},"end":{"line":10,"column":1}},"key":"MUOeyAOsGN"}],"key":"FSV2tbpIsF"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1},"end":{"line":12,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"strong","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1},"end":{"line":12,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Temporal Patterns:","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1},"end":{"line":12,"column":1}},"key":"KZ3J3BSIhJ"}],"key":"Uy8AmLuaoJ"},{"type":"text","value":" The time series reveals substantial volatility in BNPL stock returns throughout the sample period, with notable episodes of both positive and negative performance.

The DiD model achieves an R² of approximately 0.38, indicating that the included variables explain about 38% of the variation in returns across BNPL and fintech lender firms. However, the robustness check reveals that the DiD coefficient is sensitive to the inclusion of the COVID-19 period, changing from -8.35 to +6.12 when excluding February-June 2020. This sensitivity suggests that the DiD estimate may be driven by unusual conditions during the pandemic period rather than general patterns.
