The econometric specification employs a two-stage approach, beginning with a parsimonious base model and progressing to a full specification that incorporates multiple economic channels simultaneously. The analysis spans February 2020 to August 2025, comprising 67 monthly observations that capture the rapid growth phase of the BNPL industry alongside significant monetary policy shifts from near-zero rates to approximately 5%. This period provides substantial variation in the key explanatory variable, creating a natural experiment for examining how BNPL firms respond to rate changes.\n\nThe results show a negative point estimate for the relationship between interest rate changes and BNPL returns (β₁ = -12.68 in the full specification model), suggesting that a one percentage point increase in Federal Funds Rate changes is associated with approximately a 12.7% decrease in log BNPL returns. However, this coefficient is economically large but statistically indistinguishable from zero (p-value = 0.202), indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no relationship. The full specification model achieves an R² of 0.5098, indicating that the included variables collectively explain approximately 51% of the variation in log BNPL returns. Market returns (β₅ = 2.38, p < 0.001) and inflation (β₄ = -12.94, p = 0.049) are the dominant statistically significant determinants, while the Federal Funds Rate coefficient, though large in magnitude, does not achieve statistical significance. This pattern suggests that BNPL returns respond primarily through market-wide movements and inflation channels rather than through direct, statistically detectable interest rate sensitivity.\n\nThis research contributes to three distinct strands of literature: fintech firm valuation, monetary policy transmission mechanisms, and consumer credit markets research. The study provides empirical evidence on how alternative credit providers respond to macroeconomic conditions, contributing to the broader understanding of how fintech firms differ from traditional financial institutions in their response to monetary policy changes.\n\n\n\n","type":"content","url":"/paper-root","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl2":"1.

Introduction and Research Question"},"content":"How do BNPL firms’ stock returns respond to changes in the Federal Funds Rate, after controlling for market-wide movements and macroeconomic factors?\n\nThis is the question this paper answers. BNPL firms operate differently from traditional banks: they rely on wholesale funding (warehouse credit facilities, securitization, commercial paper) rather than consumer deposits, and they operate with thin profit margins. When interest rates rise, their funding costs increase immediately, and those thin margins mean even small cost increases can eliminate profitability. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reports that BNPL Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) grew from USD 2 billion in 2019 to USD 24.2 billion in 2021, while unit margins declined from 1.27% in 2020 to 1.01% in 2021—a 20% compression in a single year. This combination of extreme growth and falling margins is exactly why we care about interest rate pass-through: even small increases in funding costs can eliminate already-thin profit margins, making BNPL firms particularly vulnerable to monetary policy changes. However, we lack quantitative evidence on how their stock returns actually respond to interest rate changes.\n\nThis question matters because understanding how these firms respond to monetary policy helps investors assess risk and helps policymakers understand financial stability implications. Unlike traditional financial institutions that benefit from deposit bases and diversified revenue streams, BNPL firms operate under a fundamentally distinct business model characterized by wholesale funding dependence and razor-thin profit margins.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-1-introduction-and-research-question","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"1.1.1 U.S. BNPL Market Context and Growth Statistics","lvl2":"1.

However, this growth comes with risks. About 61% of BNPL borrowers have subprime credit scores, and 34-41% report late payments. Approximately 63% of BNPL borrowers originated multiple simultaneous loans in 2022, and 33% held loans across multiple BNPL providers. This customer base—financially constrained consumers with high debt burdens and loan stacking behavior—suggests BNPL firms are vulnerable to economic shocks. These patterns imply that BNPL returns should be particularly exposed to tightening cycles, since a more fragile borrower base is likely to reduce spending and default more as rates rise. When interest rates rise or consumer spending falls, these borrowers are more likely to default, directly affecting BNPL profitability and stock returns.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-1-1-1-u-s-bnpl-market-context-and-growth-statistics","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"1.1.2 Klarna’s IPO: Natural Experiment","lvl2":"1.

The company’s valuation collapsed from USD 46 billion in 2021 to USD 13-14 billion by 2025—a 70% decline that coincided precisely with the Fed’s rate hikes from near-zero to 5%. This happened despite continued revenue growth, suggesting the collapse reflected investor concerns about profitability in a higher-rate environment, not operational failure.\n\nImportant caveat: Klarna operates under a European banking license and funds loans through consumer deposits, unlike most U.S. BNPL firms that rely on wholesale funding. This means Klarna’s sensitivity profile differs from firms like Affirm or PayPal. The case study illustrates the general principle that BNPL valuations respond to interest rates, but the specific mechanisms may vary by funding structure.\n\nThis case motivates the regression analysis, but the regression is needed because Klarna alone is not enough evidence. Klarna went public at the very end of our sample period (September 2025), so its stock data cannot be directly incorporated into the regression. Moreover, Klarna’s deposit-funded model differs from the wholesale-funded U.S. BNPL firms that comprise our portfolio.

Literature Review: BNPL Market Dynamics and Interest Rate Sensitivity"},"content":"This section reviews the existing academic and empirical literature on Buy-Now-Pay-Later firms, focusing on findings that inform my understanding of BNPL firms’ sensitivity to monetary policy changes. Before proceeding, I define what I mean by “interest-rate sensitivity” in the context of BNPL firms: the responsiveness of BNPL firms’ stock returns, profitability, and business operations to changes in benchmark interest rates (specifically, the Federal Funds Rate) that affect their cost of capital through wholesale funding markets. This sensitivity operates primarily through three channels: (1) direct funding cost pass-through, where increases in benchmark rates raise BNPL providers’ borrowing costs from warehouse facilities, securitization markets, and commercial paper markets; (2) competitive substitution effects, where higher interest rates on credit cards and personal loans increase consumer demand for BNPL products; and (3) capital market access, where rising rates affect investor expectations and BNPL firms’ ability to raise capital. This definition distinguishes BNPL interest-rate sensitivity from traditional consumer credit products, recognizing that many BNPL products are interest-free for consumers (if paid on time) and funded primarily through merchant fees and provider borrowing costs rather than consumer interest charges.\n\nThe literature spans multiple dimensions: consumer spending patterns, credit market dynamics, firm-level funding structures, and interest rate transmission mechanisms. However, a critical gap exists: while extensive research examines BNPL adoption, consumer behavior, and market growth, relatively little empirical work directly links BNPL firm performance to monetary policy changes through stock return analysis. This gap motivates my empirical analysis, which seeks to quantify BNPL firms’ interest-rate sensitivity using stock return data while controlling for confounding factors.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-2-literature-review-bnpl-market-dynamics-and-interest-rate-sensitivity","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"2.1 Consumer Spending Patterns and BNPL Adoption","lvl2":"2.

Literature Review: BNPL Market Dynamics and Interest Rate Sensitivity"},"content":"Di Maggio, Williams, and Katz (2022) analyze how BNPL access affects consumer spending behavior using transaction-level data from major BNPL providers covering millions of transactions. They find that BNPL access increases total spending by approximately $130 per week on average. This substantial increase demonstrates that BNPL functions not merely as a payment method but as a mechanism that facilitates additional consumption. The authors identify what they term a “liquidity flypaper effect,” whereby BNPL liquidity drives additional same-category expenditure. Consumers who gain access to BNPL tend to increase spending within the same product categories rather than simply shifting spending across categories.\n\nMost importantly for understanding BNPL firms’ sensitivity to economic conditions, Di Maggio et al. show that spending remains elevated for 24 weeks after first BNPL use. This persistence creates sustained revenue streams for BNPL providers. The 24-week persistence effect demonstrates that consumer spending variables, particularly measures of consumer confidence and disposable income, predict BNPL stock returns. Changes in aggregate consumer spending directly affect BNPL transaction volumes and revenue. The persistent 24-week spending effect implies that BNPL firms’ revenue streams exhibit some stability, but consumer sentiment and economic conditions also play crucial roles in determining BNPL demand. This creates a channel through which macroeconomic variables affect BNPL stock performance.\n\nDi Maggio et al. also find that BNPL usage is concentrated among consumers with moderate to high credit scores (680-740), suggesting that BNPL serves consumers who have credit capacity but prefer BNPL’s payment structure over traditional credit cards. This finding contradicts evidence from other sources (discussed below) that BNPL users have lower credit scores. For this analysis, I rely on the CFPB’s characterization (subprime borrowers with high utilization) for three reasons: (1) the CFPB uses comprehensive credit bureau data covering all major BNPL providers, (2) their sample is more recent (2022-2023), and (3) subprime borrower characteristics are more consistent with the high default rates documented across multiple sources. This characterization strengthens the theoretical prediction that BNPL firms are sensitive to economic conditions, as financially constrained borrowers reduce spending and increase defaults when interest rates rise.\n\nGathergood et al. (2019) examine how consumers manage multiple debt obligations using data on 1.4 million individuals in the United Kingdom over a two-year period. They document that individuals allocate only 51.5% of their excess payments to the high APR card, behavior that is virtually indistinguishable from a completely non-responsive baseline (50%). To minimize interest charges, individuals should allocate 97.1% of excess payments to the high APR card, yet only 10% of individuals put 100% of their excess payments on the high interest rate card (when 85% should do so). Critically, the degree of misallocation is invariant to the difference in interest rates across cards (which can be as large as 15 percentage points), the size of the repayment amount, and the time since account opening, suggesting that optimization frictions or learning cannot explain the observed behavior. Instead, Gathergood et al. find that balance matching—whereby the share of repayments on each card matches the share of balances on each card—captures more than half of the predictable variation in repayment behavior and is the best fit model for roughly half of observations. This behavioral pattern has implications for understanding BNPL loan stacking behavior. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau documents that 63% of BNPL borrowers originated multiple simultaneous loans in 2022, and 33% held loans across multiple BNPL providers (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, “Consumer Use”). The balance-matching behavior documented by Gathergood et al. suggests that consumers facing multiple debt obligations may be vulnerable to broader economic shocks that affect their ability to manage repayments.\n\nBian, Cong, and Ji (2023) analyze BNPL’s role in payment competition and credit expansion using transaction data from e-commerce platforms. They find that BNPL significantly boosts consumption, contributing to credit expansion beyond what traditional credit cards provide. BNPL users increase total spending by approximately 15-20% compared to non-users. BNPL also dominates e-wallet transactions, accounting for over half of such transactions. This demonstrates BNPL’s substantial market share in digital payment ecosystems and establishes that BNPL firms’ performance is closely tied to e-commerce growth.\n\nBian et al. also show complementarity between BNPL and credit cards for small-value transactions. BNPL does not simply replace credit cards but expands the overall credit market. This demonstrates that BNPL firms benefit from broader credit availability even as they compete with traditional credit providers. Most relevant for my empirical analysis, they find that BNPL adoption is driven by consumer behavior and spending decisions. Higher consumer confidence leads to more discretionary spending via BNPL. A one-standard-deviation increase in consumer confidence is associated with approximately 8-12% increase in BNPL transaction volume. This demonstrates that consumer sentiment variables predict BNPL stock returns and motivates including consumer confidence measures in my regression analysis. Consumer sentiment represents an important channel through which macroeconomic conditions affect BNPL firm performance.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-2-1-consumer-spending-patterns-and-bnpl-adoption","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"2.2 Credit Market Conditions and BNPL Profitability","lvl2":"2.

Literature Review: BNPL Market Dynamics and Interest Rate Sensitivity"},"content":"Having examined demand-side factors (consumer spending patterns and adoption), I now turn to supply-side considerations: how BNPL firms’ credit assessment and profitability structures affect their sensitivity to interest rate changes. BNPL firms’ business models and funding structures determine how interest rate changes translate into profitability impacts, which ultimately affect stock returns.\n\nLaudenbach et al. (2025) demonstrate that BNPL firms operate with thin profit margins, offering consumers 1.4 percentage point interest rate discounts compared to traditional credit products. Critically, they document that BNPL firms’ funding costs increase by 0.8-1.0 percentage points for each percentage point increase in benchmark rates, indicating near-complete pass-through of monetary policy changes.\n\nThese findings provide strong theoretical support for expecting BNPL stock returns to respond negatively to interest rate increases. Funding cost increases directly compress profit margins and reduce profitability, which should be reflected in stock returns.\n\nLaudenbach et al. also show that BNPL firms benefit from private information about borrower repayment behavior that is not available to traditional lenders. BNPL customers pay approximately 1.4 percentage points less interest than comparable borrowers, representing a 15% reduction in interest rates. BNPL customers’ internal credit scores improve by 8-10 points, and BNPL customers with three or more transactions are approximately 30 percentage points more likely to be approved for bank loans compared to similar non-BNPL customers. This demonstrates that BNPL serves as a credit-building mechanism.\n\nWhile Laudenbach et al.'s analysis focuses on European markets using proprietary data from a single European bank partnership, limiting generalizability to U.S. BNPL firms, the fundamental mechanism—thin margins combined with wholesale funding dependence—applies broadly across BNPL business models. My analysis addresses this limitation by examining U.S. publicly traded BNPL firms directly through stock return data.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Market Trends Report (2022) provides evidence on BNPL firms’ profitability and cost structure using data from five major BNPL providers covering approximately 80% of the U.S. BNPL market. The report’s quantitative findings inform my understanding of BNPL firms’ vulnerability to interest rate changes.\n\nBuchak et al. (2018) document the rapid growth of fintech and shadow bank lenders, showing that shadow banks’ market share in mortgage origination nearly doubled from roughly 30% in 2007 to 50% in 2015. This growth has been particularly robust in markets serving less creditworthy borrowers, with shadow banks holding 75% market share in the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) market in 2015. An important segment of this growth were fintech lenders that primarily originate mortgages online, which expanded rapidly since 2007 and accounted for a quarter of shadow bank origination in 2015. This growth pattern, driven by regulatory arbitrage and technological advantages, is consistent with BNPL’s rapid expansion. Importantly, Buchak et al. note that shadow banks’ funding structures create greater sensitivity to market conditions and funding cost changes compared to traditional banks with deposit funding, supporting the theoretical prediction that BNPL firms exhibit heightened interest rate sensitivity.\n\nThe report documents that net transaction margins declined from 1.27% in 2020 to 1.01% in 2021, representing a 20% decline in profitability margins over a single year. This margin compression occurred alongside increases in credit loss provisions, which rose from 1.15% in 2020 to 1.30% in 2021, representing a 13% increase in credit losses. Merchant discount fees also declined, falling from 2.91% in 2020 to 2.49% in 2021, representing a 14% decline that reflects competitive pressures in merchant acquisition.\n\nMost relevant for my empirical analysis, the report notes that cost of funds increased in early-to-mid 2022, though this period falls outside the primary survey window. This indicates that the margin compression documented in 2020-2021 worsened as interest rates increased. These findings provide direct evidence that BNPL firms operate with extremely thin margins (approximately 1% net transaction margins), making them vulnerable to cost increases.\n\nThe combination of declining transaction margins, increasing credit losses, and rising funding costs demonstrates that BNPL firms face substantial pressure on profitability, which is reflected in stock returns. The 20% margin decline over a single year, combined with the documented increase in funding costs, provides quantitative evidence supporting my hypothesis that BNPL stock returns should respond negatively to interest rate increases. Given these thin margins, small increases in funding costs can substantially impact profitability.\n\nResearch examining BNPL from the merchant perspective provides additional insights into the competitive dynamics and pricing pressures that affect BNPL firms’ profitability. Berg et al. (2025) examine BNPL from the merchant’s perspective, arguing that BNPL functions as a price-discrimination mechanism that allows merchants to offer effectively lower prices to low-creditworthiness customers. They confirm that making BNPL available increases merchant sales by 20%, with effects at the extensive margin accounting for 60-70% of the total effect. Critically, offering BNPL to low-creditworthiness customers has greater effects on sales than offers to any other group: purchases of low-creditworthiness customers are two to three times as responsive as purchases of high-creditworthiness customers. The benefits of offering BNPL significantly outweigh the costs for merchants, explaining the rapid adoption of BNPL in e-commerce. This merchant-side evidence complements the consumer-side findings of Di Maggio et al. (2022) and provides important context for understanding BNPL firms’ business models and revenue streams. The finding that BNPL is particularly effective for low-creditworthiness customers suggests that BNPL firms’ revenue (merchant discount fees) may be vulnerable to competitive pressures that reduce merchant market power.\n\nMerchants’ adoption decisions and fee negotiations directly impact BNPL firms’ revenue streams. BNPL providers compete for merchant partnerships while maintaining profitability. The decline in merchant discount fees documented in the CFPB Market Trends Report reflects competitive pressures in merchant acquisition. This demonstrates that BNPL firms have limited ability to pass funding cost increases to merchants, particularly in competitive markets. This constraint on pricing flexibility amplifies BNPL firms’ sensitivity to interest rate changes. They cannot easily adjust merchant fees to offset rising funding costs.\n\nThe broader fintech literature provides context for understanding how alternative financial service providers respond to macroeconomic conditions. Research on BNPL regulation and consumer financial behavior offers additional insights into how BNPL firms operate and respond to economic conditions.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-2-2-credit-market-conditions-and-bnpl-profitability","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"2.3 Consumer Credit Characteristics and Financial Vulnerability","lvl2":"2.

Literature Review: BNPL Market Dynamics and Interest Rate Sensitivity"},"content":"While sections 2.1 and 2.2 examined aggregate spending patterns and firm-level profitability structures, understanding the characteristics of BNPL borrowers themselves provides crucial microeconomic foundations for predicting how economic conditions affect BNPL firms. The credit profile and financial vulnerability of BNPL users determine default risk, repayment capacity, and sensitivity to economic shocks, all of which directly affect BNPL firms’ profitability and stock performance. However, the literature reveals a notable contradiction regarding BNPL users’ credit profiles that warrants critical examination. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Consumer Use Report (2023) analyzes the demographic and credit profile of BNPL borrowers. The report finds that BNPL borrowers have subprime credit scores (580-669) compared to non-users (670-739). This indicates that BNPL serves consumers with lower credit quality. This finding contradicts Di Maggio et al.'s (2022) finding that BNPL usage is concentrated among consumers with moderate to high credit scores (680-740). This contradiction reflects several factors: different data sources (transaction-level provider data versus credit bureau data), different time periods, or different definitions of BNPL users (first-time users versus repeat users). The CFPB report’s use of credit bureau data may capture a broader population of BNPL users, including those who use BNPL infrequently or have limited credit histories, while Di Maggio et al.'s transaction-level data may focus on more active BNPL users. This methodological difference highlights the importance of understanding data sources and sample selection when interpreting findings across studies.\n\nThe CFPB report finds that BNPL borrowers exhibit higher credit card utilization rates (60-66% versus 34% for non-BNPL users) and are more likely to revolve on credit cards (69% versus 42%). The high credit card utilization rates (60-66%) documented by the CFPB suggest that BNPL users carry substantial existing debt burdens, limiting their capacity to absorb additional costs. Research on BNPL and financial wellbeing demonstrates that BNPL usage patterns are associated with financial vulnerability and stress, with high utilization rates predicting financial distress.\n\nAgarwal et al. (2009) document that financial decision-making quality varies systematically over the lifecycle, with younger consumers demonstrating higher rates of suboptimal borrowing and debt management behavior. Given that BNPL users skew younger and have limited credit experience, this suggests that the BNPL customer base may be particularly prone to overextension. This demographic concentration amplifies BNPL firms’ credit risk exposure during economic stress periods.\n\nBerg et al. (2020) examine how fintech lenders use digital footprints and alternative data for credit assessment using more than 250,000 observations from an E-commerce company in Germany. They find that digital footprint variables equal or exceed the information content of credit bureau scores: the area under the curve (AUC) using digital footprint variables alone is 69.6%, higher than the AUC using credit bureau score alone (68.3%). When combined, the digital footprint and credit bureau score achieve an AUC of 73.6%, representing a 5.3 percentage point improvement over the credit bureau score alone. The correlation between digital footprint-based scores and credit bureau scores is approximately 10%, indicating that digital footprints complement rather than substitute for traditional credit information. Critically, Berg et al. show that the discriminatory power of digital footprints for unscorable customers (those without credit bureau scores) matches that for scorable customers (72.2% versus 69.6% in-sample, 68.8% versus 68.3% out-of-sample), demonstrating that digital footprints can facilitate credit access for borrowers with limited traditional credit histories. This finding suggests that BNPL firms’ informational advantages, documented by Laudenbach et al. (2025), may be particularly valuable for serving consumers who lack traditional credit records, though the effectiveness of these models during periods of macroeconomic stress remains an open question.\n\nPowell et al. (2023) examine the relationship between responsible financial behaviors and financial wellbeing among BNPL users using a survey of 360 BNPL users in Australia and structural equation modeling. They find that thorough examination of BNPL terms and conditions has the largest coefficient (0.40) and highest significance on financial wellbeing, followed by planning and budgeting (coefficient 0.23, significant at 1% level). Lower compulsive buying also has a significantly positive impact on financial wellbeing (coefficient 0.11), with impulse buying influencing compulsive buying (coefficient 0.36). However, using a debit card instead of a credit card and having multiple BNPL purchases on the go simultaneously were found to have no significant impact on financial wellbeing. Critically, Powell et al. find that younger users (aged under 25) exhibit significantly riskier financial behaviors: they spend less time analyzing BNPL terms and conditions (significant at 1% level), are less likely to plan and budget for purchases (significant at 5% level), and have significantly lower financial wellbeing scores (significant at 1% level). The <25 age group had a higher rate of missed payments (48% versus 39% for the 25+ group) and a larger proportion fell into lower financial wellbeing categories (25% versus 15% for the 25+ group). This finding is consistent with Agarwal et al.‘s (2009) documentation that younger consumers make the worst financial decisions. The concentration of BNPL usage among younger consumers with less financial experience amplifies BNPL firms’ exposure to default risk during economic downturns, creating an additional channel through which economic conditions affect BNPL firm performance.\n\nHayashi and Routh (2024) examine financial constraints among BNPL users. They find that BNPL users tend to be more financially vulnerable than non-users. There is a high correlation between BNPL late payments and financial vulnerability. BNPL users with late payments have overspent or overextended debt. This demonstrates that BNPL access facilitates overconsumption among financially constrained consumers. This finding has implications for understanding BNPL firms’ sensitivity to economic conditions. Financially vulnerable consumers are likely to reduce spending and increase defaults when interest rates rise or economic conditions deteriorate.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Making Ends Meet Report (2022) provides broader context on financial vulnerability and income variability that affects BNPL users, using survey data from over 10,000 households. The report’s findings inform my understanding of how macroeconomic conditions affect BNPL demand.\n\nThe report documents that income variability increased sharply from 2021 to 2022. The share of households experiencing income fluctuations rose from 28% in 2021 to 35% in 2022, creating conditions where consumers turn to BNPL to manage cash flow fluctuations. The report finds that 37% of households could not cover expenses for more than one month if income were lost, indicating widespread financial fragility that makes consumers particularly sensitive to economic shocks. Credit card debt increased substantially for Hispanic consumers and those under 40 between June 2021 and September 2022. Average credit card debt increased by approximately 15-20% for these demographic groups, demonstrating that these demographic groups, which overlap significantly with BNPL users, faced particular financial stress during this period.\n\nFinancial well-being, which had improved during the pandemic, returned to 2019 levels by February 2022. This indicates a deterioration in household financial conditions that coincided with the Federal Reserve’s initial interest rate increases. These patterns demonstrate that BNPL firms serve consumers who face income volatility and financial constraints. BNPL demand is sensitive to changes in household financial conditions that are affected by interest rate changes and broader economic conditions. The documented relationship between income variability and BNPL usage provides motivation for including disposable income measures in my regression analysis. Changes in household financial conditions should affect BNPL demand and, consequently, BNPL stock returns.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond’s research (2024) provides complementary evidence. Financially fragile consumers (credit score below 620, recent credit denials) are almost three times more likely to have repeated BNPL use (five or more times) compared to financially stable consumers. The study finds that 72% of financially stable users and 89% of financially fragile users made multiple BNPL purchases. This indicates high rates of repeat usage. Most concerning, 10% of BNPL users pay BNPL installments with credit cards. This creates debt accumulation patterns that amplify financial vulnerability.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-2-3-consumer-credit-characteristics-and-financial-vulnerability","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"2.4 Market Growth and Industry Dynamics","lvl2":"2.

Literature Review: BNPL Market Dynamics and Interest Rate Sensitivity"},"content":"The preceding sections have examined consumer behavior, firm profitability, and borrower characteristics. I now shift to a macro perspective: understanding the scale and trajectory of BNPL market growth provides essential context for evaluating the sector’s sensitivity to economic conditions. Market size, growth rates, and industry structure affect how interest rate changes propagate through the sector and influence investor expectations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Market Trends Report (2022) analyzes the rapid growth of the BNPL industry. BNPL gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew from 2 billion in 2019 to 24.2 billion in 2021, representing a 1,092% compound annual growth rate. Transaction volume grew from 16.8 million loans in 2019 to 180 million loans in 2021, representing a 970% compound annual growth rate. Average loan size increased from 121 in 2019 to 135 in 2021, indicating both volume and size growth. BNPL accounts for 2-4% of e-commerce transactions, indicating substantial but not dominant market share. The report also shows vertical diversification. Apparel and beauty decreased from 80.1% of GMV in 2019 to 58.6% in 2021, while grocery and everyday purchases grew at a 736% compound annual growth rate. This diversification demonstrates that BNPL is expanding beyond discretionary purchases into everyday spending, which affects sensitivity to economic conditions.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Consumer Use of Buy Now, Pay Later Report (2025) provides updated analysis on market trends and regulatory developments affecting the sector. The report documents continued growth in BNPL adoption and examines the implications of regulatory changes, including the CFPB’s May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit card issuers. This regulatory shift affects BNPL firms’ funding structures, compliance costs, and competitive positioning, altering their sensitivity to interest rate changes. The report also examines consumer use patterns and debt accumulation, providing updated evidence on how BNPL fits into consumers’ broader credit portfolios. The report’s findings on consumer debt accumulation patterns and regulatory changes inform my understanding of how BNPL firms respond to changing market conditions and interest rate environments.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (2024) finds that BNPL grew particularly rapidly during the low-interest rate environment of the pandemic period. This indicates that interest rate conditions affect BNPL growth and profitability. This temporal pattern provides additional evidence that BNPL firms’ performance is sensitive to monetary policy conditions. The sector’s rapid expansion coincided with historically low interest rates.\n\nResearch on BNPL regulation provides insights into how regulatory frameworks affect BNPL firms’ operations and sensitivity to economic conditions. Johnson, Rodwell, and Hendry (2021) examine the regulatory framework governing BNPL services, arguing that fee-based BNPL demonstrates multiple forms of regulatory failure. They identify regulatory capture as a key issue, with minimal consumer protections despite the complexity of BNPL financial products. Their analysis suggests that consumers may lack the financial knowledge required to fully understand BNPL terms and risks, particularly regarding fee structures and debt accumulation. This regulatory gap is significant because it allows BNPL firms to operate with less oversight than traditional credit providers, potentially exposing financially vulnerable consumers to greater risk. The regulatory uncertainty also affects BNPL firms’ business models and funding structures, creating additional sensitivity to regulatory changes such as the CFPB’s May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit card issuers.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-2-4-market-growth-and-industry-dynamics","position":21},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"2.5 Interest Rate Sensitivity and Funding Structure","lvl2":"2.

Literature Review: BNPL Market Dynamics and Interest Rate Sensitivity"},"content":"The preceding sections have established the demand-side (consumer spending), supply-side (profitability structures), borrower characteristics, and market growth contexts. I now directly examine the core research question: the mechanisms through which interest rate changes affect BNPL firms. This section synthesizes evidence on funding structures, cost pass-through mechanisms, and firm-level responses to monetary policy changes, providing the theoretical foundation for my empirical analysis.\n\nThe theoretical framework for understanding financial institutions’ interest rate sensitivity derives from Flannery and James (1984), who examine how financial institution stock returns respond to interest rate changes. They document that institutions with asset-liability maturity mismatches exhibit significant sensitivity to rate movements, with the magnitude depending on the duration gap structure. This framework applies directly to BNPL firms: their reliance on short-term wholesale funding combined with longer-maturity loan portfolios creates the duration mismatch that amplifies interest rate sensitivity.\n\nBNPL firms exhibit sensitivity to interest rate changes primarily through their funding structure. Laudenbach et al. (2025) show that BNPL firms offer 1.4 percentage point interest rate discounts to consumers, indicating thin profit margins that amplify sensitivity to funding cost changes. BNPL firms must borrow capital from wholesale markets, creating direct exposure to interest rate changes that is not mitigated by deposit funding. This funding structure creates a transmission mechanism whereby monetary policy changes directly affect BNPL firms’ cost of capital, which in turn affects profitability and stock returns.\n\nResearch on financial intermediation and funding costs provides theoretical foundations for understanding this mechanism. Institutions relying on wholesale funding exhibit stronger responses to interest rate changes than deposit-funded institutions. Wholesale funding costs adjust immediately to policy rate changes, while deposit rates adjust more slowly, creating differential sensitivity patterns. This framework helps explain why BNPL firms, which rely almost exclusively on wholesale funding, exhibit immediate pass-through of monetary policy changes to funding costs, unlike traditional banks that benefit from deposit funding stability.\n\nAs detailed in Section 1.1.2, Klarna’s valuation trajectory from its 46 billion peak in June 2021 to its 13-14 billion IPO valuation in September 2025 provides compelling evidence of BNPL firms’ sensitivity to interest rate environments. The 70% valuation decline coincided precisely with the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle, demonstrating how monetary policy affects BNPL firms through multiple channels: direct funding costs, capital market access, and investor expectations.\n\nAffirm Holdings’ Annual Report (2024) identifies “elevated interest rate environment” as a key risk factor, explicitly acknowledging interest rate sensitivity. The report shows that Affirm relies on warehouse credit facilities, securitization, and sale-and-repurchase agreements for funding, all of which typically carry variable interest rates tied to benchmark rates. According to Affirm’s 10-K filings, funding costs increased dramatically during the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle (see Appendix A.1 for detailed analysis). The company uses interest rate swaps and caps to manage interest rate exposure, indicating that management recognizes the risk posed by interest rate changes.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (2024) finds that BNPL grew during the low-interest rate environment of the pandemic, demonstrating that interest rate conditions affect BNPL growth and profitability. The report also notes regulatory changes, specifically the CFPB’s May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit card issuers, which affects BNPL firms’ regulatory environment and funding costs. These firm-level disclosures and regulatory observations provide concrete evidence of the mechanisms through which monetary policy affects BNPL firms, supporting the theoretical framework that motivates our empirical analysis.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-2-5-interest-rate-sensitivity-and-funding-structure","position":23},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl2":"2.6 Research Contribution and Literature Gaps"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/paper-root#id-2-6-research-contribution-and-literature-gaps","position":24},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl2":"2.6 Research Contribution and Literature Gaps"},"content":"This study contributes to three distinct strands of literature, each addressing important gaps in understanding of fintech firm behavior and monetary policy transmission. Before detailing these contributions, I explicitly identify the gaps in existing research that motivate this study.\n\nGap 1: No Quantitative Estimates of BNPL Stock Return Sensitivity to Monetary Policy\n\nWhile extensive research documents BNPL’s rapid growth (CFPB 2022) and thin profit margins (Laudenbach et al. 2025), no study quantifies how BNPL equity returns respond to Federal Funds Rate changes. This gap matters because:\n\nStock returns incorporate forward-looking expectations about profitability\n\nReturns reflect multiple transmission channels simultaneously (funding costs, consumer demand, capital access)\n\nInvestors need quantitative estimates to price BNPL-specific interest rate risk\n\nPolicymakers need evidence on whether monetary policy disproportionately affects BNPL firms\n\nExisting studies examine either consumer-side effects (Di Maggio et al. 2022) or firm-level margins (CFPB 2022), but none estimate the elasticity of BNPL stock returns to interest rate changes using multi-factor models that control for market movements and macroeconomic conditions. Bian, Cong, and Ji (2023) examine BNPL’s role in payment competition and credit expansion, documenting that BNPL significantly boosts consumption and complements credit cards for small-value transactions, but do not directly address stock return sensitivity to interest rates. Laudenbach et al. (2025) analyze BNPL firms’ funding costs and profitability, finding that funding costs increase with benchmark rates, but their analysis focuses on European markets and does not examine stock returns.\n\nGap 2: Methodological Limitations in Existing Studies\n\nExisting studies face several methodological constraints that limit their ability to establish causal relationships between interest rates and BNPL performance. Many studies rely on cross-sectional data or short time series that do not capture the full variation in monetary policy conditions. For example, the CFPB Market Trends Report covers 2019-2021, a period characterized primarily by low and stable interest rates, limiting its ability to examine interest-rate sensitivity. Additionally, many studies lack appropriate control variables to isolate interest-rate effects from other macroeconomic factors. My analysis addresses these limitations by using a longer time series (February 2020 to August 2025) that captures substantial variation in monetary policy, and by controlling for market returns, consumer confidence, disposable income, and inflation.\n\nGap 3: Limited Analysis of Transmission Mechanisms\n\nWhile the literature identifies potential mechanisms through which interest rates may affect BNPL firms (funding costs, consumer demand, capital market access), few studies systematically examine these mechanisms empirically or quantify their relative importance. My analysis addresses this gap by estimating a multi-factor regression model that allows me to examine multiple transmission channels simultaneously while isolating the direct effect of interest rate changes.\n\nContributions:\n\nFirst, in the fintech valuation literature, this study analyzes how alternative financial service providers respond to macroeconomic shocks. While extensive research exists on traditional bank sensitivity to interest rates (Flannery and James 1984), relatively little work has analyzed how newer fintech lending models, particularly BNPL firms, respond to monetary policy changes. Research on BNPL regulation and consumer financial behavior provides important context but does not address stock return sensitivity to monetary policy. This study fills this gap by providing empirical evidence on BNPL firms’ sensitivity to monetary policy, contributing to the broader understanding of how fintech firms differ from traditional financial institutions in their response to macroeconomic conditions.\n\nSecond, the study contributes to the monetary policy transmission literature by exploring how unconventional credit providers transmit monetary policy to consumers. Traditional monetary policy transmission mechanisms focus on banks’ lending channels, where policy rate changes affect bank funding costs, which in turn affect lending rates and credit availability. However, BNPL firms represent an alternative credit provision mechanism that amplifies policy effects through different channels. Laudenbach et al. (2025) document that BNPL firms offer 1.4 percentage point interest rate discounts to consumers, indicating thin profit margins that amplify sensitivity to funding cost changes. Hayashi and Routh (2024) examine financial constraints among BNPL users, finding that BNPL borrowers exhibit higher credit card utilization rates and greater financial stress, which amplifies their sensitivity to economic shocks and interest rate changes. This study examines how these thin margins translate into stock return sensitivity, providing insights into monetary policy transmission through alternative credit channels and contributing to the understanding of how monetary policy affects different segments of the credit market.\n\nThird, the study contributes to consumer credit markets research by analyzing the relationship between monetary policy and consumer credit availability through BNPL firms. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Consumer Use Report documents that BNPL borrowers have subprime credit scores (580-669) compared to non-users (670-739), higher credit card utilization rates (60-66% versus 34%), and are more likely to revolve on credit cards (69% versus 42%) (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, “Consumer Use”). Recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond documents the rapid growth of BNPL adoption and its implications for consumer credit markets, noting that BNPL has expanded particularly rapidly among younger consumers and those with limited access to traditional credit (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond). Understanding how monetary policy affects BNPL firms’ ability to extend credit to these consumers has important implications for financial inclusion and consumer welfare, particularly given that BNPL serves consumers who have limited access to traditional credit products.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-2-6-research-contribution-and-literature-gaps","position":25},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl2":"2.7 Firm-Level Context: PayPal and Affirm"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/paper-root#id-2-7-firm-level-context-paypal-and-affirm","position":26},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl2":"2.7 Firm-Level Context: PayPal and Affirm"},"content":"Firm-level financial analysis provides microeconomic foundations for understanding BNPL firms’ interest rate sensitivity.

According to Affirm’s 10-K filings, funding costs increased dramatically during the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle (see Appendix A.1 for detailed analysis). This demonstrates the direct pass-through mechanism: as benchmark rates increase, variable-rate funding facilities reset at higher rates, increasing the cost of capital. Affirm’s high leverage and thin operating margins amplify the impact of funding cost increases on profitability. PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) operates a more diversified business model, with BNPL representing only a portion of its overall operations, potentially providing natural hedging against BNPL-specific funding cost pressures.

These mechanisms inform the empirical analysis presented in Section 4 (Data Analysis) and motivate the inclusion of specific control variables in my regression framework.\n\nInterest Rate Sensitivity Hypothesis: The literature provides strong theoretical motivation for expecting negative relationships between Federal Funds Rate changes and BNPL stock returns. Laudenbach et al. (2025) find that BNPL firms’ funding costs increase by approximately 0.8-1.0 percentage points for each percentage point increase in benchmark interest rates. This indicates near-complete pass-through of monetary policy changes to funding costs. Affirm’s 10-K filings provide firm-level evidence of this mechanism: according to Affirm’s filings, funding costs increased dramatically during the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle (see Appendix A.1 for detailed analysis). Combined with thin profit margins (approximately 1% net transaction margins per CFPB Market Trends Report) and high leverage, these findings indicate that interest rate increases compress profit margins and reduce profitability. This should be reflected in negative stock returns. This theoretical framework motivates my primary hypothesis: BNPL stock returns respond negatively to Federal Funds Rate increases, after controlling for market movements and other macroeconomic factors.\n\nConsumer Confidence Channel: The literature shows strong relationships between consumer sentiment and BNPL demand. Bian, Cong, and Ji (2023) find that a one-standard-deviation increase in consumer confidence is associated with approximately 8-12% increase in BNPL transaction volume. This indicates that consumer sentiment represents an important channel through which macroeconomic conditions affect BNPL firm performance. Di Maggio, Williams, and Katz (2022) find that BNPL access increases spending by approximately $130 per week, with spending remaining elevated for 24 weeks. This indicates that consumer spending patterns directly affect BNPL revenue streams. These findings motivate including consumer confidence measures in my regression analysis. Changes in consumer sentiment should affect BNPL demand and, consequently, stock returns.\n\nDisposable Income Channel: The CFPB Making Ends Meet Report (2022) finds that income variability increased sharply from 2021 to 2022. Thirty-seven percent of households were unable to cover expenses for more than one month if income were lost. The report also finds that credit card debt increased substantially for demographic groups that overlap significantly with BNPL users. This indicates that changes in household financial conditions affect BNPL demand. These patterns indicate that disposable income measures should be included in my regression analysis. Changes in household financial conditions affect BNPL demand and stock returns.\n\nMarket Returns and Inflation: The literature provides less direct evidence on market returns and inflation effects. However, standard asset pricing theory, particularly the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and multi-factor models, suggests that BNPL stock returns should be correlated with market returns through systematic risk factors. The high market beta observed in my regression results (β₅ = 2.38) confirms this theoretical prediction. Inflation may affect BNPL firms through multiple channels: its impact on consumer purchasing power reduces discretionary spending capacity, its effect on funding costs increases the cost of capital, and its influence on economic uncertainty affects consumer confidence and credit demand. I include these variables as controls to isolate the effect of interest rate changes while accounting for broader market movements and macroeconomic conditions, ensuring that my interest rate coefficient captures BNPL-specific sensitivity rather than general market or macroeconomic effects.\n\nEmpirical Strategy: My regression framework, detailed in Section 4, employs a log-linear specification that allows me to estimate elasticities of BNPL stock returns with respect to interest rate changes and other macroeconomic variables. This functional form choice is motivated by both theoretical considerations and empirical evidence. The log transformation addresses heteroskedasticity and distributional skewness common in financial return data, while facilitating elasticity interpretation that is standard in financial econometrics. I employ a two-stage approach that follows established practices in monetary policy transmission research. I begin with a parsimonious base specification that examines the relationship between BNPL returns and interest rate changes, providing a benchmark estimate of interest rate sensitivity. I then estimate a full specification model that incorporates consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation, and market returns as control variables. This sequential estimation strategy serves multiple purposes: it allows me to assess both direct effects of monetary policy on BNPL stock performance and the incremental explanatory power of including additional control variables, it tests the theoretical mechanisms identified in the literature review above, and it enables me to examine the robustness of the interest rate coefficient to the inclusion of control variables, addressing concerns about omitted variable bias.\n\n\n\n","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-2-8-bridge-to-empirical-analysis-literature-informed-hypotheses","position":29},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl2":"3.

The study employs a log-linear regression framework to estimate relationships between BNPL stock returns and a set of economic variables, including interest rate changes, consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation, and market returns. We use log-transformed BNPL returns as the dependent variable to facilitate elasticity interpretation and address common issues in financial return data (see Appendix for detailed justification).\n\nThe modeling strategy employs a two-stage approach, beginning with a parsimonious base specification that examines the relationship between BNPL returns and interest rate changes, followed by a full specification model that incorporates multiple economic channels simultaneously. This sequential estimation strategy enables us to assess both direct effects of monetary policy on BNPL stock performance and the incremental explanatory power of including additional control variables. All models are estimated using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression with robust standard errors (HC3) to address heteroskedasticity, which is a common feature of financial return data.\n\nThe motivation for this work stems from the rapid growth and increasing economic significance of the BNPL sector. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s 2025 report, BNPL adoption has experienced substantial growth, with 21% of consumers with credit records utilizing BNPL services in 2022, representing an increase from 18% in 2021. This expansion, combined with the sector’s sensitivity to funding costs and capital market conditions, makes understanding the determinants of BNPL stock returns relevant for both investors seeking to assess risk exposure and policymakers concerned with financial stability and consumer protection. The sector’s reliance on short-term funding markets and its sensitivity to consumer spending patterns indicate that BNPL stock returns respond systematically to changes in monetary policy, macroeconomic conditions, and broader market movements. The extent and nature of these relationships are the focus of this analysis.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-3-data-analysis-interest-rate-sensitivity-and-economic-determinants","position":31},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl2":"3.1 Data Construction and Variable Selection"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/paper-root#id-3-1-data-construction-and-variable-selection","position":32},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl2":"3.1 Data Construction and Variable Selection"},"content":"This section describes the data construction process and the rationale for variable selection in our econometric models.

(PYPL), Affirm Holdings Inc. (AFRM), and Sezzle Inc. (SEZL). These firms were selected based on criteria established in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Market Trends Report, which identifies major BNPL providers in the U.S. market.\n\nSeveral important limitations affect this firm selection. First, the sample excludes other major BNPL providers that are not publicly traded (e.g., Klarna, Afterpay prior to acquisition, Zip) or that went public after our sample period ends (e.g., Klarna IPO in September 2025). Second, the sample excludes firms with insufficient trading history or data availability issues (e.g., Block/Square’s BNPL operations are not separately traded). Third, the sample may suffer from survivorship bias, as only firms that survived and went public are included.\n\nThese limitations mean our results may not generalize to the broader BNPL sector, particularly smaller providers or those operating under different business models. However, the three firms included represent substantial market coverage: PayPal’s BNPL product (Pay in 4) represents 68.1% of U.S. BNPL market share, making it the largest BNPL provider. Affirm and Sezzle are pure-play BNPL providers that went public in 2020-2021, providing representative coverage of the sector’s business models.\n\nPortfolio Weighting: Equal vs. Value Weighting\n\nWe construct the BNPL portfolio using equal weighting, where each firm receives equal weight regardless of market capitalization. This approach has both advantages and limitations.\n\nEqual weighting reduces the dominance of PayPal, which has substantially larger market capitalization than Affirm or Sezzle. This ensures that pure-play BNPL firms (Affirm, Sezzle) receive equal representation in the portfolio, capturing sector-wide patterns rather than being dominated by PayPal’s diversified operations. Equal weighting also reduces the influence of market capitalization changes that may be unrelated to BNPL-specific factors.\n\nHowever, equal weighting creates a distorted representation of the sector’s economic importance. PayPal’s BNPL operations represent the majority of market share, yet receive only one-third weight in the portfolio. This may bias results if PayPal exhibits different sensitivity patterns than pure-play BNPL firms. Additionally, Sezzle’s small market capitalization and limited liquidity may introduce noise into the portfolio return.\n\nAs a robustness check, we examine specifications excluding PayPal (Section 4.6.5) and excluding Sezzle to assess sensitivity to portfolio construction choices. Alternative portfolio constructions—value-weighted portfolios, principal component analysis, or firm-level panel regressions—are discussed in robustness checks but not implemented due to sample size constraints.\n\nReturn Calculation and Log Transformation\n\nFor each individual BNPL company, we calculate monthly returns as:R_{i,t} = \\frac{P_{i,t} - P_{i,t-1}}{P_{i,t-1}} \\times 100\n\nwhere P_{i,t} is the month-end closing price for firm i in month t. The portfolio return is then calculated as the equally-weighted average:R_{t}^{BNPL} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} R_{i,t}\n\nwhere N = 3 (PYPL, AFRM, SEZL).\n\nThe dependent variable uses a log transformation: \\log(1 + R_{t}^{BNPL}/100) \\times 100. This transformation addresses distributional skewness, stabilizes variance, and facilitates elasticity interpretation of coefficients.

The portfolio return is calculated as an equally-weighted average of the three firms’ returns. The log transformation \\log(1 + R_{t}^{BNPL}/100) \\times 100 is applied to address right-skewness in return distributions and to facilitate elasticity interpretation. This transformation ensures that returns are defined for all values including negative returns (which cannot be log-transformed directly). The mean return of 0.85% per month (approximately 10.2% annualized) reflects the sample period’s mixed performance, while the standard deviation of 12.34% indicates substantial volatility. This high volatility (12.34% monthly standard deviation) means that even economically meaningful relationships may fail to achieve statistical significance, which helps explain why our interest rate coefficient is economically large but statistically insignificant.\n\nFederal Funds Rate Changes: We calculate month-over-month changes by taking first differences of the effective Federal Funds Rate from FRED. The mean change of 0.02 percentage points reflects the gradual nature of monetary policy adjustments, while the standard deviation of 0.18 percentage points captures periods of rapid policy shifts (notably 2022-2023). The range from -0.50 to +0.75 percentage points reflects the Federal Reserve’s most aggressive tightening cycle since the 1980s. The preponderance of zero observations (rate unchanged for multiple months) creates measurement challenges but aligns with how monetary policy actually operates. This low-frequency variation (many zero observations) reduces statistical power to detect relationships, which may explain why our interest rate coefficient fails to achieve statistical significance despite its economic magnitude.\n\nConsumer Confidence Changes: Month-over-month changes in the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index capture shifts in forward-looking consumer expectations. The mean change of -0.15 points reflects overall sentiment decline during the sample period (driven by pandemic uncertainty and inflation concerns), while the large standard deviation (4.82 points) captures substantial month-to-month volatility in consumer sentiment. The index ranges from 50 to 150, with changes reflecting shifts in consumer spending intentions that directly affect BNPL transaction volume. This volatility in consumer sentiment creates substantial variation that should help identify relationships, yet our consumer confidence coefficient approaches but does not achieve statistical significance, suggesting that market returns may capture much of the systematic variation in consumer sentiment.\n\nDisposable Income Changes: We calculate month-over-month percentage changes in real (inflation-adjusted) disposable personal income from FRED. The mean growth rate of 0.18% per month (approximately 2.2% annualized) reflects moderate income growth during the sample period, while the standard deviation of 0.78% captures substantial variation including pandemic-related income shocks. Negative values (minimum -2.10%) reflect periods of income decline, while positive values capture income recovery and growth phases.\n\nInflation Changes: Month-over-month percentage changes in the seasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index capture inflation shocks affecting consumer purchasing power. The mean change of 0.42% per month (approximately 5.0% annualized) reflects elevated inflation during much of the sample period, while the standard deviation of 0.58% captures substantial variation from near-zero inflation (2020) to peak inflation (mid-2022). The range from -0.80% to +1.60% reflects deflationary and hyperinflationary episodes within the sample.\n\nMarket Returns: Monthly returns on the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) proxy for systematic market risk. The mean return of 0.89% per month (approximately 10.7% annualized) reflects overall market performance during the sample period, while the standard deviation of 4.52% indicates substantial market volatility. The range from -12.35% to +9.25% captures major market movements including pandemic-related crashes and recovery rallies. The fact that market returns explain 51% of BNPL return variation (R² = 0.51) indicates that systematic market factors dominate BNPL stock performance, potentially obscuring the relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns.\n\nInterest Rate Variable: Federal Funds Rate Changes\n\nWe use month-over-month changes in the Federal Funds Rate (\\Delta FFR_t) rather than levels. This choice addresses several concerns. First, interest rate levels may be non-stationary, while changes are typically stationary (though ADF tests show mixed results, see Section 4.3.4). Second, changes capture policy shifts more directly than levels, which may reflect long-term trends unrelated to current policy. Third, changes align with the theoretical mechanism: BNPL firms respond to funding cost changes, not absolute rate levels.\n\nHowever, using monthly changes creates measurement challenges. The Federal Funds Rate changes infrequently (often remaining constant for multiple months), creating many zero observations. This low-frequency variation may create attenuation bias and reduce statistical power. Alternative specifications using 2-year Treasury yield changes (Section 4.6.1) address this concern by providing higher-frequency variation.\n\nLag Structure and Timing Considerations\n\nMacroeconomic variables are measured contemporaneously with BNPL returns, creating potential simultaneity concerns. Macro data is typically released during the month (e.g., CPI released mid-month), while stock returns reflect information available throughout the month. This timing mismatch may bias estimates if macro data releases affect stock prices within the same month.\n\nIdeally, we would use lagged macro variables (e.g., \\Delta CC_{t-1}, \\Delta DI_{t-1}) to ensure that macro conditions are known before stock returns are realized. However, using contemporaneous variables captures the forward-looking nature of stock prices, which incorporate expectations about future macro conditions. As a robustness check, we examine specifications with lagged macro variables (discussed in Section 4.6), though results are not substantially different.\n\nMarket Returns\n\nWe use the S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (SPY) as a proxy for broad market returns. The S&P 500 represents approximately 80% of U.S. equity market capitalization and provides a comprehensive benchmark for systematic market risk. Monthly returns are calculated as percentage changes in month-end closing prices, ensuring temporal alignment with BNPL stock returns.\n\nConsumer Confidence\n\nWe employ the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (UMCSENT) as a measure of forward-looking consumer spending intentions. This index captures consumers’ expectations about future economic conditions and their own financial situation, which should directly affect BNPL usage as consumers make purchasing decisions. We calculate month-over-month changes to capture shifts in consumer sentiment that may affect BNPL transaction volume.\n\nDisposable Income\n\nWe use real disposable personal income (DSPIC96) from FRED, which measures inflation-adjusted personal income after taxes. This variable captures the income channel through which economic conditions affect consumer purchasing power and BNPL usage. We calculate percentage changes (month-over-month) to measure growth in disposable income, which is more economically meaningful than levels for analyzing the relationship with stock returns.\n\nInflation\n\nWe employ the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Seasonally Adjusted (CPIAUCSLSA) as a measure of inflation. We use the seasonally adjusted series to remove predictable seasonal patterns (such as holiday shopping effects) that could confound our analysis. Seasonal adjustment is important for CPI because consumer prices can exhibit regular seasonal fluctuations that are unrelated to underlying inflation trends. We calculate month-over-month percentage changes to capture inflation shocks that may affect consumer purchasing power and spending patterns.\n\nSeasonal Adjustment\n\nWe use seasonally adjusted data where available to remove predictable seasonal patterns that could confound our analysis. Real disposable personal income (DSPIC96) is obtained from FRED in seasonally adjusted form by default. Consumer Price Index (CPIAUCSLSA) is obtained as the seasonally adjusted series to remove seasonal patterns in consumer prices. Consumer sentiment (UMCSENT) and Federal Funds Rate (FEDFUNDS) do not require seasonal adjustment, as consumer sentiment is a survey-based index and interest rates do not exhibit predictable seasonal patterns. Stock returns are already in first-difference form (monthly changes) and do not require seasonal adjustment.\n\nData Alignment and Temporal Coverage\n\nSample Period and Observations: The sample period spans from February 2020 to August 2025, providing 67 monthly observations. This period encompasses several important macroeconomic events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, monetary policy tightening in 2022-2023, and subsequent policy normalization, providing substantial variation in both dependent and independent variables necessary for econometric inference.\n\nTemporal Alignment: All variables are aligned to monthly frequency and synchronized to month-end dates to ensure temporal consistency. Stock prices are measured at month-end closing prices, and macroeconomic variables are aligned to the same month-end dates. This synchronization ensures that all variables reflect conditions during the same time period.\n\nMissing Data Handling: We handle missing data using inner joins when merging variables from different sources. This approach retains only observations where all variables have complete data, ensuring a balanced panel dataset. After merging, we apply an additional dropna() operation to remove any remaining missing values. This conservative approach ensures that our final sample consists of 67 complete observations with no missing data across any variable. No observations were excluded due to missing data, indicating complete data availability across all variables for the sample period.\n\nData Quality: All variables exhibit complete coverage for the sample period. Stock return data from Yahoo Finance provides continuous coverage for all three BNPL firms throughout the period. Macroeconomic data from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) provides complete monthly series for all variables. The final dataset contains no missing values, ensuring that all 67 observations are used in regression estimation.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-3-1-2-variable-definitions-and-data-sources","position":37},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"3.1.3 Interest Rate Variable Selection: Theoretical and Empirical Considerations","lvl2":"3.1 Data Construction and Variable Selection"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/paper-root#id-3-1-3-interest-rate-variable-selection-theoretical-and-empirical-considerations","position":38},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"3.1.3 Interest Rate Variable Selection: Theoretical and Empirical Considerations","lvl2":"3.1 Data Construction and Variable Selection"},"content":"The selection of an appropriate interest rate variable requires balancing theoretical relevance with empirical considerations. While multiple interest rate measures could potentially capture BNPL firms’ funding costs, we focus on the Federal Funds Rate for several reasons. First, BNPL firms rely heavily on short-term funding markets, including warehouse credit facilities, securitization markets, and commercial paper markets, all of which are directly influenced by the Federal Funds Rate. Second, the Federal Funds Rate serves as the primary monetary policy instrument, making it the most policy-relevant measure for understanding how monetary policy affects BNPL stock returns. Third, data availability and reliability favor the Federal Funds Rate, which is published daily by the Federal Reserve and has a long historical record.\n\nAlternative interest rate measures, such as commercial paper rates or credit spreads, could theoretically provide more direct measures of BNPL firms’ actual funding costs. However, these alternatives face data availability constraints and are highly correlated with the Federal Funds Rate, making the incremental benefit of using alternative measures limited. The Federal Funds Rate provides a clean, policy-relevant measure that captures the primary channel through which monetary policy affects BNPL firms’ cost of capital.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-3-1-3-interest-rate-variable-selection-theoretical-and-empirical-considerations","position":39},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"3.1.4 Model Specification: Theoretical Framework","lvl2":"3.1 Data Construction and Variable Selection"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/paper-root#id-3-1-4-model-specification-theoretical-framework","position":40},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"3.1.4 Model Specification: Theoretical Framework","lvl2":"3.1 Data Construction and Variable Selection"},"content":"The econometric models we estimate are motivated by theoretical considerations regarding the determinants of equity returns in general and BNPL stock returns in particular. The base model focuses on interest rate sensitivity, motivated by the sector’s reliance on short-term funding markets documented by the CFPB (2025). The full specification model extends this framework by incorporating additional economic channels that theory suggests should affect BNPL stock performance: consumer spending patterns (captured by consumer confidence and disposable income), purchasing power effects (captured by inflation), and systematic market risk (captured by market returns).\n\nBase Model Specification:\\log(1 + BNPL\\_Return_t/100) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(\\Delta Federal\\_Funds\\_Rate_t) + \\varepsilon_t\n\nwhere BNPL_Return_t is the monthly return in percentage terms. The transformation log(1 + BNPL_Return_t/100) addresses distributional skewness, truncation at -100%, and approximates continuously compounded returns. This specification tests the hypothesis that BNPL stock returns are associated with changes in short-term interest rates, which would be expected given BNPL firms’ reliance on funding markets. The coefficient \\beta_1 measures the elasticity of BNPL returns with respect to Federal Funds Rate changes, with a negative coefficient expected if higher interest rates increase funding costs and reduce profitability.\n\nFull Specification Model:\\log(1 + BNPL\\_Return_t/100) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(\\Delta Federal\\_Funds\\_Rate_t) + \\beta_2(\\Delta Consumer\\_Confidence_t) + \\beta_3(\\Delta Disposable\\_Income_t) + \\beta_4(\\Delta Inflation_t) + \\beta_5(Market\\_Return_t) + \\varepsilon_t\n\nThis specification extends the base model by incorporating control variables that capture additional economic channels affecting BNPL stock returns. The inclusion of these variables serves multiple purposes: (1) controlling for factors that may be correlated with interest rates, providing a more accurate estimate of the direct interest rate effect; (2) capturing additional economic mechanisms that theory suggests should affect BNPL performance; and (3) improving model fit and reducing omitted variable bias.\n\nThe theoretical justification for each control variable stems from understanding how BNPL firms generate revenue and face costs. Consumer confidence affects forward-looking spending intentions, directly influencing BNPL transaction volume. Disposable income affects consumers’ ability to make purchases and use BNPL services. Inflation affects purchasing power and may influence consumer spending patterns. Market returns capture systematic market risk, isolating BNPL-specific effects from general market movements. Together, these variables provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the multiple economic channels affecting BNPL stock performance.\n\n\n\n# ============================================================================\n# FIRM-LEVEL FINANCIAL HEALTH ANALYSIS: PayPal and Affirm\n# ============================================================================\n# Analysis Period: 2020-2025\n# Focus: Financial health trends, profitability, cash flow, operational metrics\n# ============================================================================\n\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# print(\"Firms: PayPal Holdings Inc.

The log transformation, calculated as log(1 + return/100), is applied for several methodological reasons that we discuss in detail below, but the visual representation helps us understand the temporal patterns in BNPL stock performance before we begin formal econometric analysis.\n\nWhy Log Transformation? Before discussing the patterns visible in the chart, it is worth explaining why we transform returns using the natural logarithm. Financial return data commonly exhibit heteroskedasticity, where the variance of returns changes over time—typically higher during volatile periods and lower during calm periods. Log transformations help stabilize this variance structure, making the data more suitable for regression analysis. Additionally, equity returns often exhibit right-skewed distributions due to the presence of extreme positive returns, and log transformations help normalize these distributions, improving the validity of statistical inference. Finally, the log-linear specification facilitates elasticity interpretation: regression coefficients can be interpreted as percentage changes in returns per unit change in independent variables, providing intuitive economic meaning.\n\nTemporal Patterns: The time series reveals substantial volatility in BNPL stock returns throughout the sample period, with notable episodes of both positive and negative performance. This volatility is not random but corresponds to distinct macroeconomic and sector-specific events that inform our understanding of BNPL stock performance. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 coincided with significant negative returns, reflecting initial market uncertainty regarding BNPL firms’ ability to weather economic disruption. Investors were concerned about potential deterioration in consumer credit quality, reduced consumer spending, and the sector’s ability to maintain transaction volume during an economic downturn.\n\nThe period of strong positive returns in late 2020 and 2021 reflects the rapid growth in BNPL adoption documented by the CFPB (2025), as consumers turned to alternative payment methods during the pandemic. This period saw increased transaction volume and revenue growth for BNPL providers, as consumers shifted purchasing behavior toward e-commerce and sought flexible payment options during a period of economic uncertainty. The sharp negative returns observed in mid-2022 align with rising interest rates and increased funding costs, consistent with the CFPB’s documentation that BNPL firms’ cost of funds increased substantially during this period. Higher interest rates compressed profit margins and reduced investor confidence, as the sector’s thin margins (provider revenues represent only about 4% of gross merchandise volume according to Digital Silk, 2025) made firms particularly vulnerable to funding cost increases.\n\nThe period from late 2023 through 2025 exhibits continued volatility, reflecting ongoing sensitivity to monetary policy changes, macroeconomic conditions, and sector-specific developments. This persistent volatility provides empirical motivation for our econometric analysis, which seeks to identify systematic factors that explain this observed variation.\nVisual Design Elements: The chart uses blue shading to indicate periods of positive returns (above the zero line) and orange shading to indicate negative returns (below zero). This visual distinction facilitates identification of periods when BNPL stocks outperformed relative to their long-run average versus periods of underperformance. The dashed horizontal line at zero provides a reference point for assessing whether returns are positive or negative in any given month.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-3-2-1-chart-a-time-series-of-log-bnpl-returns","position":45},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"3.2.2 Chart B: Scatter Plot of Log BNPL Returns vs Interest Rate Changes","lvl2":"3.2 Visual Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis and Preliminary Patterns"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/paper-root#id-3-2-2-chart-b-scatter-plot-of-log-bnpl-returns-vs-interest-rate-changes","position":46},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"3.2.2 Chart B: Scatter Plot of Log BNPL Returns vs Interest Rate Changes","lvl2":"3.2 Visual Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis and Preliminary Patterns"},"content":"\n\nChart B presents a scatter plot of log BNPL returns against month-over-month changes in the Federal Funds Rate, accompanied by the estimated regression line and 95% confidence interval. This visualization provides a direct visual test of our primary hypothesis that BNPL stock returns exhibit sensitivity to monetary policy changes. The scatter plot displays monthly observations (blue circles) with the fitted regression line (orange) and confidence interval (light orange shading), enabling visual assessment of the relationship between interest rate changes and BNPL stock returns.\n\nVisual Interpretation: The scatter plot reveals substantial dispersion around the regression line, with many observations deviating significantly from the fitted line. This dispersion is not merely noise but reflects the presence of other factors beyond interest rates that substantially affect BNPL stock performance. The negative slope of the regression line (estimated coefficient of -12.51) is visible in the chart, showing a negative point estimate, though this relationship is not statistically significant in BNPL returns, consistent with theoretical expectations. However, the wide confidence interval (indicated by the light orange shading) reflects substantial uncertainty around this estimate, consistent with the high volatility observed in the time series plot.\n\nStatistical Interpretation: The regression results indicate a negative relationship between interest rate changes and log BNPL returns, the point estimate aligns with theoretical predictions, but statistical insignificance prevents us from concluding a relationship exists on BNPL firm performance. The estimated slope coefficient is -12.51, The point estimate indicates that a one percentage point increase in the Federal Funds Rate change would be associated with approximately a 12.51% decrease in log BNPL returns, but this relationship is not statistically significant and we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no effect. However, this relationship is not statistically significant at conventional levels (p-value = 0.2202), and the R² of 0.022 indicates that interest rate changes alone explain only 2.2% of the variation in log BNPL returns. The 95% confidence interval for the slope coefficient is [-32.69, 7.67], which includes zero and reflects substantial uncertainty around the point estimate, consistent with the high volatility observed in the time series plot and the presence of other unobserved factors affecting BNPL returns.\n\nImplications for Model Specification: The substantial dispersion around the regression line provides empirical motivation for our full specification model, which incorporates additional control variables to capture these other economic channels and improve the model’s explanatory power. The fact that interest rates alone explain only 2.2% of return variation suggests that other factors play important roles in determining BNPL stock performance, motivating the inclusion of consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation, and market returns in the full model.\n\nVisual Design Elements: The x-axis tick marks are set at 0.1 percentage point intervals to provide clear visual reference points for interpreting the magnitude of interest rate changes and facilitate comparison across observations. The blue color scheme for observations and orange for the regression line maintains visual consistency with Chart A, while the confidence interval shading provides visual representation of statistical uncertainty around the point estimate.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-3-2-2-chart-b-scatter-plot-of-log-bnpl-returns-vs-interest-rate-changes","position":47},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl2":"3.3 Functional Form Selection: Justification for Log-Linear Specification"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/paper-root#id-3-3-functional-form-selection-justification-for-log-linear-specification","position":48},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl2":"3.3 Functional Form Selection: Justification for Log-Linear Specification"},"content":"We use log-transformed BNPL returns as the dependent variable to address heteroskedasticity, normalize distributions, and facilitate elasticity interpretation of coefficients.

This structure allows us to isolate the partial effect of interest rate changes while controlling for other factors that simultaneously affect BNPL returns. This decomposition is crucial because it separates BNPL-specific sensitivity from general market movements, enabling us to test whether BNPL stocks respond to interest rates beyond their correlation with the broader market.\n\nIdentification Challenges: Several identification challenges affect our ability to estimate causal effects.\n\nEndogeneity from Simultaneous Determination: Federal Funds Rate changes are not exogenous shocks—they respond to economic conditions (inflation, unemployment, GDP growth) that also affect BNPL returns. When the Fed raises rates in response to inflation, both the rate increase and the underlying inflation affect BNPL returns simultaneously. This creates endogeneity bias: our coefficient captures both the direct effect of interest rates and the indirect effect of the economic conditions that prompted the rate change. This means our estimate may be biased upward (less negative) if inflation negatively affects BNPL returns independently of interest rates, or biased downward (more negative) if economic growth positively affects BNPL returns.\n\nOmitted Variable Bias: Several unobserved factors may correlate with both interest rates and BNPL returns, biasing our estimates:\n\nRegulatory changes: The CFPB’s May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit cards occurred during a period of rising interest rates. If this regulatory change affected BNPL stock prices independently of interest rates, our coefficient would be biased. Similarly, state-level regulatory changes or enforcement actions may coincide with monetary policy cycles.\n\nCompetitive dynamics: Entry of new BNPL providers, merchant partnerships, or competitive pricing changes may correlate with economic conditions that also affect interest rates. For example, during economic expansions (when rates may rise), BNPL firms may face increased competition, affecting stock returns independently of funding costs.\n\nFirm-specific news: Earnings announcements, product launches, management changes, or credit quality disclosures may correlate with macroeconomic conditions that prompt interest rate changes. If these firm-specific factors affect BNPL returns independently of interest rates, our coefficient would be biased.\n\nSector-specific shocks: Fintech sector sentiment, technology stock performance, or broader fintech regulatory developments may correlate with monetary policy cycles, creating omitted variable bias.\n\nReverse Causality: While unlikely, several reverse causality channels could bias our estimates:\n\nFinancial stability channel: If BNPL stock performance signals broader financial stability concerns (e.g., widespread credit defaults), the Fed may respond by adjusting monetary policy. However, BNPL firms represent a small portion of the economy, making this channel unlikely to materially affect Federal Funds Rate decisions.\n\nCredit market channel: If BNPL stock performance reflects broader credit market conditions that the Fed monitors, monetary policy may respond to these conditions. However, the Fed primarily responds to aggregate economic indicators rather than individual stock performance.\n\nIndirect feedback: BNPL stock performance may affect consumer confidence or spending patterns, which the Fed monitors. However, this indirect channel is likely weak given BNPL’s small market share relative to overall consumer spending.\n\nThese challenges mean we cannot interpret our coefficient as a causal effect, but rather as a conditional association that provides evidence on whether BNPL stocks exhibit sensitivity patterns consistent with theoretical predictions.\n\nIdentification Strategy: We address these challenges through several approaches. First, we control for market returns, which capture systematic risk factors that may be correlated with interest rates. Second, we include macroeconomic controls (consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation) that may confound the interest rate relationship. Third, we use robust standard errors to address heteroskedasticity that could bias inference. However, these approaches do not fully resolve endogeneity concerns—our estimates should be interpreted as associations rather than causal effects. This limitation is important because it means we cannot definitively conclude that interest rate changes cause BNPL return changes, only that they are associated conditional on our controls.\n\nWhat We Can Identify: Our regression framework identifies the partial correlation between interest rate changes and BNPL returns, conditional on the included control variables. This partial correlation captures how BNPL returns move with interest rates after accounting for market movements and macroeconomic conditions. While this does not establish causality, it provides descriptive evidence on whether BNPL stocks exhibit sensitivity patterns consistent with theoretical predictions. This evidence is valuable for investors assessing risk exposure and policymakers understanding monetary policy transmission, even if it does not establish causality.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-3-4-2-regression-structure-and-identification","position":55},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"3.4.3 Identification Assumptions","lvl2":"3.4 Model Estimation and Identification Strategy"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/paper-root#id-3-4-3-identification-assumptions","position":56},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"3.4.3 Identification Assumptions","lvl2":"3.4 Model Estimation and Identification Strategy"},"content":"To interpret our coefficient estimates as meaningful associations, we rely on several identification assumptions:\n\nAssumption 1: Conditional Exogeneity: Conditional on the included control variables (market returns, consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation), Federal Funds Rate changes are uncorrelated with the error term. This assumption requires that all factors that simultaneously affect both interest rates and BNPL returns are included in the model. If this assumption is violated—for example, if regulatory changes or competitive dynamics correlate with both interest rates and BNPL returns—our coefficient estimates may be biased.\n\nAssumption 2: Linearity: The relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns is linear. This assumption allows us to interpret the coefficient as a constant elasticity. If the relationship is nonlinear (e.g., sensitivity increases at higher rate levels), our linear specification may miss important patterns.\n\nAssumption 3: No Simultaneity: BNPL stock returns do not affect Federal Funds Rate changes within the same month. This assumption is likely satisfied given that BNPL firms represent a small portion of the economy, making it unlikely that their stock performance influences monetary policy decisions. However, if the Fed responds to broader fintech or credit market conditions that correlate with BNPL returns, this assumption may be violated.\n\nAssumption 4: Stable Parameters: The relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns is constant over the sample period. This assumption allows us to pool observations across time. If sensitivity patterns changed as the BNPL sector matured or as regulatory frameworks evolved, our estimates would represent an average effect that may not reflect current conditions.\n\nWhat These Assumptions Mean: These assumptions are standard in observational studies but are not testable directly. We assess their plausibility through robustness checks (alternative specifications, sample periods, interest rate measures) and diagnostic tests (residual analysis, stability tests). The fact that our coefficient remains stable across specifications provides some evidence that these assumptions may be approximately satisfied, though we cannot definitively verify them.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-3-4-3-identification-assumptions","position":57},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"3.4.4 Model Limitations","lvl2":"3.4 Model Estimation and Identification Strategy"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/paper-root#id-3-4-4-model-limitations","position":58},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"3.4.4 Model Limitations","lvl2":"3.4 Model Estimation and Identification Strategy"},"content":"This analysis faces several constraints that affect interpretation.

Third, the portfolio approach masks firm-level heterogeneity—individual BNPL firms may exhibit different sensitivity patterns that are obscured by aggregation.

These visualizations complement the numerical statistics presented in the regression tables by offering intuitive graphical representations of model fit, residual patterns, and model comparison. Each plot serves a specific diagnostic purpose, helping us assess whether our models satisfy key econometric assumptions and providing insights into potential model improvements.\n\nPlot C: Time Series of Log BNPL Returns (Top-Left) displays the dependent variable over time, showing the temporal patterns and volatility that our models seek to explain. This plot helps identify periods of extreme returns, potential outliers, and temporal trends that may inform our understanding of BNPL stock performance.\n\nPlot D: Scatter Plot of Log BNPL Returns vs Interest Rate Changes (Top-Middle) visualizes the relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns using the full specification model (best model). The scatter plot shows individual monthly observations (blue circles) along with the fitted regression line (orange) from the full model, which controls for all five economic variables. This visualization helps assess the partial effect of interest rates on BNPL returns while controlling for other factors.\n\nPlot E: Residuals Plot for Full Model (Top-Right) plots the residuals (observed minus fitted values) against fitted values for the full specification model (best model). This diagnostic plot helps assess whether the full model satisfies the homoskedasticity assumption—if residuals are randomly scattered around zero with constant variance, the assumption is satisfied. Patterns in the residuals (such as fanning or curvature) would suggest heteroskedasticity or nonlinearity, which would require model adjustments.\n\nPlot F: Residuals Plot Comparison (Bottom-Left) shows residuals from the base model for comparison purposes, allowing us to visually assess the improvement in model fit achieved by including control variables. A more random scatter pattern in the full model (Plot E) compared to the base model would suggest that the additional variables help capture systematic patterns that were causing heteroskedasticity in the base model.\n\nPlot G: Q-Q Plot for Full Model (Bottom-Middle) assesses whether the residuals from the full specification model (best model) are normally distributed, which is an assumption underlying many statistical tests. The Q-Q plot compares the quantiles of the residuals to the quantiles of a normal distribution—if residuals are normally distributed, the points should fall approximately along a straight line. Deviations from the line, particularly in the tails, indicate departures from normality, which may affect the validity of statistical inference.\n\nPlot H: Model Comparison: R² Values (Bottom-Right) provides a visual comparison of model fit between the base and full specification models.

SoFi is a digital financial services company offering personal loans and student loan refinancing, publicly traded on NASDAQ since June 2021. Upstart is an AI-powered lending platform partnering with banks to provide personal loans, publicly traded on NASDAQ since December 2020. LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending platform facilitating personal loans, publicly traded on NYSE since December 2014. All three firms have sufficient trading history for our analysis period and are publicly available for data collection.\n\nFintech lenders serve as a comparison group because they operate in similar markets (tech-enabled consumer credit) and face similar macroeconomic conditions, but differ in their funding structures and business models.

We estimate the DiD model using the full specification that matches our main regression analysis, incorporating control variables to address confounding factors:\\log(Return_{it}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(BNPL_i) + \\beta_2(\\Delta FFR_t) + \\beta_3(BNPL_i \\times \\Delta FFR_t) + \\beta_4(R_{Market,t}) + \\beta_5(\\Delta CC_t) + \\beta_6(\\Delta DI_t) + \\beta_7(\\Delta \\pi_t) + \\varepsilon_{it}\n\nwhere BNPL_i is a dummy variable equal to 1 for BNPL firms and 0 for fintech lenders, R_{Market,t} represents market returns, \\Delta CC_t denotes changes in consumer confidence, \\Delta DI_t represents changes in disposable income, and \\Delta \\pi_t denotes changes in inflation. The coefficient \\beta_3 captures the differential sensitivity of BNPL firms to interest rate changes, relative to fintech lenders, after controlling for market movements and other macroeconomic factors.

This robustness check tests whether our results are sensitive to the inclusion of this unusual period characterized by extreme market volatility.

The DiD model achieves an R² of approximately 0.38, indicating that the included variables explain about 38% of the variation in returns across BNPL and fintech lender firms. However, the robustness check reveals that the DiD coefficient is sensitive to the inclusion of the COVID-19 period, changing from -8.35 to +6.12 when excluding February-June 2020. This sensitivity suggests that the DiD estimate may be driven by unusual conditions during the pandemic period rather than general patterns.

This magnitude is economically substantial—if the Fed raises rates by 0.5 percentage points (a typical policy move), BNPL stocks would decline by roughly 6.4% on average. The standard error of 9.95 reflects the high volatility of BNPL returns, making it difficult to achieve statistical significance even with economically meaningful effects.

A 1% increase in market returns is associated with a 2.38% increase in BNPL returns, indicating a market beta of 2.38. This beta is more than double the average stock (β ≈ 1.0), placing BNPL stocks among the highest-beta securities in the market. The t-statistic of 7.25 and p-value < 0.001 indicate extremely strong statistical evidence. The 95% confidence interval [1.74, 3.03] excludes zero and is relatively narrow, reflecting precise estimation.\n\nInflation Coefficient (β₄ = -12.94, p-value = 0.049): This coefficient is statistically significant at the 5% level and economically large. A one percentage point increase in monthly inflation is associated with a 12.9% decrease in BNPL returns. This relationship likely operates through multiple channels: inflation erodes consumer purchasing power, reducing discretionary spending and BNPL transaction volume; inflation increases funding costs through its effect on nominal interest rates; and inflation creates economic uncertainty affecting consumer confidence. The 95% confidence interval [-25.81, -0.06] barely excludes zero, indicating marginal significance.\n\nConsumer Confidence Coefficient (β₂ = 0.75, p-value = 0.102): This coefficient approaches statistical significance (p-value = 0.102) and has the expected positive sign. A one-point increase in consumer confidence is associated with a 0.75% increase in BNPL returns. The lack of statistical significance may reflect the dominance of market returns in capturing systematic variation, or it may indicate that consumer confidence affects BNPL returns through indirect channels (such as market sentiment) rather than directly.\n\nDisposable Income Coefficient (β₃ = -0.59, p-value = 0.493): This coefficient is not statistically significant and has an unexpected negative sign. Theoretically, higher disposable income should increase BNPL usage and returns. The negative sign may reflect that income growth is correlated with other factors (such as inflation or interest rates) that negatively affect BNPL returns, or it may indicate that BNPL serves as a substitute for cash purchases rather than a complement to income. The large standard error (0.86) relative to the coefficient magnitude (-0.59) indicates imprecise estimation.\n\nConstant Term (β₀ = 4.99, p-value = 0.041): The intercept is statistically significant, indicating that BNPL returns have a positive expected value conditional on all regressors being zero.

This point estimate is economically substantial—a 0.5 percentage point rate increase would correspond to roughly a 6.4% decline in BNPL returns on average. However, the p-value of 0.202 indicates that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that this relationship is zero. The 95% confidence interval ranges from -32.2 to 6.8, which includes zero and reflects substantial statistical uncertainty around the point estimate.\n\nWhy might the effect be economically large but statistically insignificant?\n\nSeveral factors may explain this pattern. First, BNPL stocks exhibit high volatility, with monthly returns frequently exceeding 20% in absolute magnitude. This high volatility creates substantial noise that makes it difficult to detect systematic relationships, even when such relationships exist. When return variance is dominated by idiosyncratic factors, even economically meaningful effects may fail to achieve statistical significance. The standard error of 9.95 reflects this high volatility—even a coefficient of -12.68 is not large enough relative to the noise to achieve statistical significance.\n\nSecond, investors may price BNPL stocks more similarly to technology stocks than to traditional financial stocks. Technology stocks typically respond more strongly to growth expectations, competitive dynamics, and market sentiment than to interest rate changes. If BNPL stocks trade with similar characteristics, their returns would be driven primarily by factors other than funding costs. This interpretation is consistent with our finding that market returns explain substantially more of BNPL return variation (R² = 0.51 in the full model) than interest rate changes alone.\n\nThird, the relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns may be nonlinear or time-varying. BNPL firms may exhibit sensitivity only when rates cross certain thresholds, or sensitivity patterns may have evolved as the sector matured. Our linear specification cannot capture such patterns, potentially obscuring relationships that exist but are not constant across the sample period.\n\nFourth, there may be a timing mismatch between interest rate changes and stock price responses. Stock prices reflect expectations about future profitability rather than merely current funding costs. If investors have already incorporated anticipated rate changes into prices, or if they focus primarily on longer-term growth prospects, monthly rate changes may not manifest in monthly return data.\n\nWhat does this imply about BNPL stocks?\n\nThe inability to detect a statistically significant relationship does not necessarily imply that BNPL firms are unaffected by interest rates. Rather, it suggests that stock returns do not capture this sensitivity in a manner that is measurable with monthly data. This pattern may indicate that investors treat BNPL stocks as growth-oriented equities rather than rate-sensitive financial instruments, or that other factors—such as market sentiment and competitive dynamics—dominate return variation at monthly frequencies.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-4-3-interpreting-the-null-result","position":97},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"4.2 Market Beta and Systematic Risk","lvl2":"4.

This coefficient indicates that BNPL stocks exhibit a market beta of 2.38, meaning that a 1% increase in market returns is associated with a 2.38% increase in BNPL returns on average. This beta is substantially higher than the average stock (which has a beta of approximately 1.0), indicating that BNPL stocks are highly sensitive to systematic market risk.\n\nWhat does high market beta mean? The high market beta suggests that BNPL stocks amplify market movements—they rise more than the market during bull markets and fall more than the market during bear markets. This pattern is consistent with growth-oriented technology stocks, which typically exhibit high betas due to their sensitivity to growth expectations and risk sentiment. The fact that market returns explain 51% of BNPL return variation (R² = 0.51) indicates that systematic market factors dominate BNPL stock performance, while firm-specific or sector-specific factors (including interest rate sensitivity) play a smaller role.\n\nWhy is market beta so high? Several factors may explain BNPL stocks’ high market sensitivity. First, as a relatively new sector, BNPL firms face substantial uncertainty about future growth prospects, making their valuations sensitive to changes in risk sentiment. Second, BNPL stocks may be held by growth-oriented investors who trade based on market sentiment rather than fundamental analysis. Third, the high volatility of BNPL returns may reflect their status as “risk-on” assets that investors buy during optimistic periods and sell during pessimistic periods.\n\nImplications for the interest rate coefficient: The dominance of market returns in explaining BNPL return variation may explain why the interest rate coefficient is not statistically significant. If market movements capture most of the systematic variation in BNPL returns, there may be little residual variation left for interest rates to explain. This does not mean interest rates don’t matter—it means their effects may be indirect (operating through market sentiment) or may be obscured by the dominant market factor.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-4-2-market-beta-and-systematic-risk","position":99},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"4.4 Model Fit and Explanatory Power","lvl2":"4.

The full model’s adjusted R² of 0.4696 is substantially lower than the unadjusted R² (0.5098), reflecting the penalty for adding five parameters.

The R² increases to 0.6172, indicating that asset pricing factors capture additional variation. However, the interest rate coefficient’s statistical insignificance persists, suggesting that the null result is robust to alternative factor specifications.\n\nRobustness to Interest Rate Measure: When we use 2-year Treasury yield changes instead of Federal Funds Rate changes, the coefficient becomes -17.83 (p-value = 0.031), achieving statistical significance. This difference may reflect that 2-year Treasury yields provide higher-frequency variation (changing more frequently than the Federal Funds Rate) or that they better capture BNPL firms’ actual funding costs. However, this specification achieves lower R² (0.079), suggesting that it captures less of the systematic variation in BNPL returns.\n\nFirm-Level Analysis: When we estimate separate regressions for each firm, the interest rate coefficients vary substantially: PayPal (-5.01, p-value = 0.408), Affirm (-14.23, p-value = 0.507), and Sezzle (-23.10, p-value = 0.768). All remain statistically insignificant, but the variation in magnitudes suggests heterogeneity across firms. Sezzle exhibits the largest (most negative) coefficient, possibly reflecting its smaller size and greater sensitivity to funding costs, while PayPal exhibits the smallest coefficient, possibly reflecting its diversified operations and lower reliance on BNPL-specific funding.\n\nThis section presents the econometric analysis of BNPL stock returns’ sensitivity to monetary policy changes and macroeconomic factors. The analysis employs a multi-factor regression framework with comprehensive diagnostic testing, robustness checks, and factor-adjusted specifications to provide rigorous empirical evidence on the determinants of BNPL stock performance.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-4-5-comparison-with-alternative-specifications","position":103},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl2":"5.

Discussion: Interpretation and Implications"},"content":"BNPL stocks exhibit pricing behavior that differs substantially from traditional financial stocks. Banks and credit card companies demonstrate clear sensitivity to interest rate changes because their business models depend directly on net interest margins—the spread between lending rates and funding costs. When rates rise, banks’ funding costs increase, but they can pass these costs to borrowers through higher lending rates, maintaining margins. BNPL firms operate under a fundamentally different revenue model, generating income primarily through merchant fees and late payment fees rather than interest rate spreads. This structural difference suggests that BNPL firms should exhibit different sensitivity patterns, and the empirical evidence indicates that investors recognize this difference and price BNPL stocks accordingly.\n\nThe finding that market returns explain substantially more of BNPL return variation (R² = 0.51 in the full model) than interest rate changes indicates that investors treat BNPL stocks as part of the broader equity market rather than as a distinct rate-sensitive sector. This pattern is consistent with viewing BNPL firms as technology-enabled companies that provide credit services, rather than as credit companies that happen to use technology. The high market beta (β = 2.38) further supports this interpretation—BNPL stocks behave like growth-oriented technology stocks, amplifying market movements rather than responding primarily to interest rate changes.\n\nWhat this means: Investors are pricing BNPL stocks based on growth expectations, competitive dynamics, and market sentiment rather than on funding cost sensitivity. This pricing behavior reflects the sector’s status as a growth industry where future prospects matter more than current profitability. The fact that interest rate sensitivity doesn’t show up in stock returns suggests that either (1) investors don’t perceive funding costs as a major risk factor, (2) other factors dominate return variation, or (3) the sensitivity operates through indirect channels that don’t manifest in monthly return data.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-5-1-bnpl-as-an-asset-class-growth-stocks-or-financial-stocks","position":107},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"5.2 What Drives BNPL Stock Returns?","lvl2":"5.

Discussion: Interpretation and Implications"},"content":"Given that BNPL stocks do not respond significantly to interest rates in monthly data, what factors drive their returns? The evidence suggests that growth expectations, competitive dynamics, and market sentiment play dominant roles. As a relatively young sector, BNPL firms face investor focus on market share expansion, customer acquisition costs, and regulatory developments rather than short-term funding cost fluctuations.\n\nMarket Returns: The market return coefficient (β = 2.38) dominates the model, explaining most of the systematic variation in BNPL returns. This high beta indicates that BNPL stocks are “risk-on” assets that investors buy during optimistic periods and sell during pessimistic periods. The beta of 2.38 means that BNPL stocks move 2.38% for every 1% move in the market, making them highly sensitive to changes in risk sentiment and growth expectations.\n\nInflation: The inflation coefficient (β = -12.94, p-value = 0.049) is statistically significant and negative, indicating that inflation shocks reduce BNPL returns. This relationship likely operates through multiple channels: inflation erodes consumer purchasing power, reducing discretionary spending and BNPL transaction volume; inflation increases funding costs through its effect on nominal interest rates; and inflation creates economic uncertainty that affects consumer confidence and credit demand.\n\nConsumer Confidence and Disposable Income: These coefficients are not statistically significant, but their signs (positive for consumer confidence, negative for disposable income) align with theoretical expectations. The lack of significance may reflect the dominance of market returns in capturing systematic variation, or it may indicate that these variables affect BNPL returns through indirect channels.\n\nInterest Rates: The interest rate coefficient is economically large (-12.68) but statistically insignificant (p-value = 0.202). This pattern suggests that interest rates may matter for BNPL firms, but their effects are obscured by other factors or operate through channels that don’t manifest in monthly return data.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-5-2-what-drives-bnpl-stock-returns","position":109},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"5.3 Market Efficiency and Investor Attention","lvl2":"5.

Second, the effects of funding costs may be small relative to other factors (market movements, competitive dynamics) that dominate return variation. Third, investors may anticipate funding cost changes and incorporate them into prices before they materialize, making monthly changes less informative. Fourth, the relationship may be nonlinear or time-varying, requiring longer horizons or different specifications to detect.\n\nImplications: The null result suggests that BNPL stock prices may not efficiently incorporate information about funding cost sensitivity, or that this sensitivity is not a primary driver of returns.

Discussion: Interpretation and Implications"},"content":"For Investors:\n\nThe high market beta (β = 2.38) has profound implications for portfolio construction and risk management. BNPL stocks amplify market movements by a factor of 2.38, meaning that during a 10% market decline, BNPL stocks would be expected to decline by approximately 24%. This high beta makes BNPL stocks particularly risky during market downturns but potentially rewarding during bull markets. Investors holding BNPL stocks should recognize that they are taking on substantial systematic market risk, not just BNPL-specific risk.\n\nThe lack of significant interest rate sensitivity suggests that investors should focus on market sentiment, competitive dynamics, and regulatory developments rather than attempting to time monetary policy. The high volatility (standard deviation of 12.34% monthly, equivalent to approximately 43% annualized) indicates substantial risk, but this risk comes primarily from market sensitivity rather than interest rate sensitivity. This pattern suggests that BNPL stocks may be suitable for investors seeking exposure to growth-oriented technology sectors but should be avoided by investors seeking defensive positions or interest rate hedging strategies.\n\nThe fact that market returns explain 51% of BNPL return variation indicates that BNPL stocks are highly correlated with broader market movements. This high correlation reduces diversification benefits—BNPL stocks provide little protection during market downturns. However, the remaining 49% of variation reflects BNPL-specific factors (competitive dynamics, regulatory changes, firm-specific news) that may provide opportunities for active management and stock selection.\n\nFor Regulators:\n\nThe finding that BNPL stocks don’t respond significantly to interest rates in monthly data doesn’t mean that funding costs don’t affect BNPL firms’ operations. Firm-level evidence (documented in Section 3) shows that BNPL firms’ funding costs increased substantially as interest rates rose, with Affirm’s funding costs increasing by 394% from 2022 to 2024. This divergence between firm-level profitability and stock-level returns raises important questions about market efficiency and investor attention to fundamental factors.\n\nRegulators should monitor BNPL firms’ funding structures and interest rate risk exposure, particularly given their role in serving subprime consumers who may be vulnerable to economic downturns. The CFPB’s regulatory changes (including the May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit cards) may alter BNPL firms’ sensitivity to monetary policy by changing their funding structures, regulatory compliance costs, and competitive positioning. Regulators should assess how these changes affect BNPL firms’ ability to serve consumers and maintain financial stability.\n\nThe high market beta and volatility of BNPL stocks suggest that these firms may be particularly vulnerable to market disruptions and investor sentiment shifts. Regulators should consider how BNPL firms’ stock performance affects their ability to raise capital and maintain operations, particularly during periods of market stress. The fact that BNPL stocks are priced like growth stocks rather than financial stocks suggests that these firms may face different risk profiles than traditional credit providers.\n\nFor Monetary Policymakers:\n\nThe null result suggests that BNPL firms may represent a distinct channel of monetary policy transmission that operates differently from traditional financial intermediaries. While stock returns don’t show significant sensitivity, firm-level evidence suggests that funding costs do affect BNPL operations. Policymakers should consider how monetary policy affects BNPL firms’ profitability and lending capacity, even if these effects don’t manifest in monthly stock return data.\n\nThe high market beta suggests that monetary policy may affect BNPL firms indirectly through its impact on market sentiment and risk appetite. When the Fed raises rates, it may reduce market risk appetite, causing growth stocks (including BNPL stocks) to decline even if their fundamentals aren’t directly affected. This indirect transmission channel may be as important as direct funding cost effects.\n\nThe finding that inflation is statistically significant (β = -12.94, p-value = 0.049) suggests that monetary policy may affect BNPL firms through inflation channels rather than interest rate channels. Higher inflation erodes consumer purchasing power, reducing BNPL transaction volume, and increases funding costs through its effect on nominal rates. Policymakers should consider how inflation affects BNPL firms’ operations, independent of interest rate effects.\n\nThe substantial variation in interest rate sensitivity across firms (ranging from -5.01 for PayPal to -23.10 for Sezzle) suggests that monetary policy transmission may vary substantially within the BNPL sector. Policymakers should recognize this heterogeneity when assessing how monetary policy affects the sector as a whole.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-5-4-real-world-implications","position":113},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"5.5 Economic Interpretation: Why Don’t Stock Prices Reflect Funding Costs?","lvl2":"5.

Discussion: Interpretation and Implications"},"content":"The divergence between firm-level evidence (showing funding cost sensitivity) and stock-level evidence (showing no significant return sensitivity) raises fundamental questions about asset pricing and market efficiency. Several economic mechanisms may explain this pattern:\n\nGrowth Stock Valuation Model: BNPL stocks may be valued using a growth stock model where future growth prospects dominate current profitability. In this framework, investors focus on market share expansion, customer acquisition, and long-term growth potential rather than short-term cost factors. Funding costs may affect profitability, but if investors believe that BNPL firms can grow their way out of cost pressures, stock prices may not respond to funding cost changes.\n\nMarket Sentiment Dominance: The high market beta (2.38) suggests that BNPL stock prices are driven primarily by market sentiment and risk appetite rather than fundamental analysis. During periods of high risk appetite, growth stocks (including BNPL) rise regardless of funding costs. During periods of low risk appetite, growth stocks fall regardless of fundamentals. This sentiment-driven pricing may obscure the relationship between funding costs and stock returns.\n\nAnticipated Effects: Stock prices reflect expectations about future profitability, not just current conditions. If investors anticipated interest rate increases and incorporated them into prices before they materialized, monthly rate changes may not show up in monthly returns. The fact that BNPL stock prices declined substantially during 2022-2023 (when rates rose) suggests that investors did incorporate rate expectations, but this incorporation may have occurred gradually rather than month-by-month.\n\nNonlinear and Time-Varying Relationships: The relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns may be nonlinear or time-varying. BNPL firms may exhibit sensitivity only when rates cross certain thresholds (e.g., above 3% or 4%), or sensitivity patterns may have changed as the sector matured. Our linear specification cannot capture such patterns, potentially obscuring relationships that exist but are not constant.\n\nIndirect Transmission Channels: Interest rates may affect BNPL firms through indirect channels that don’t manifest in monthly return data. Higher rates may reduce consumer spending (affecting BNPL transaction volume), increase credit card competition (making BNPL less attractive), or affect investor risk appetite (reducing demand for growth stocks). These indirect effects may take months or quarters to materialize, requiring longer horizons to detect.","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-5-5-economic-interpretation-why-dont-stock-prices-reflect-funding-costs","position":115},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"5.6 Limitations and Future Research Directions","lvl2":"5.

It is possible that funding costs affect profitability in ways that do not manifest in monthly stock returns, either because investors do not incorporate this information efficiently or because other factors dominate price movements.\n\nKey Limitations:\n\nFirst, the limited sample size (67 monthly observations) reduces statistical power to detect relationships. With only 67 observations and multiple regressors, we may fail to reject the null hypothesis even when economically meaningful relationships exist. A larger sample size (e.g., weekly or daily data) would substantially improve statistical power.\n\nSecond, we use Federal Funds Rate changes rather than exogenous monetary policy shocks. Federal Funds Rate changes respond to economic conditions that also affect BNPL returns, creating potential endogeneity. Event studies around FOMC announcements using high-frequency data could provide cleaner identification of causal effects.\n\nThird, the portfolio approach masks firm-level heterogeneity. Individual BNPL firms may exhibit different sensitivity patterns that are obscured by aggregation. Panel data analysis with firm fixed effects could provide more granular insights into heterogeneity across firms.\n\nFourth, we cannot establish causality from observational data alone. Results should be interpreted as associations rather than causal effects. Instrumental variables approaches or natural experiments could provide more credible causal estimates.\n\nFuture Research Directions:\n\nFuture research could examine BNPL firms’ actual financial performance metrics—including revenue growth, profit margins, and credit loss rates—to determine whether the business model exhibits sensitivity to interest rates even if stock prices do not. Such analysis would provide a more complete understanding of how monetary policy affects BNPL firms’ operations, independent of how investors price these effects in equity markets.\n\nEvent studies around FOMC announcements using high-frequency (daily or intraday) data could provide cleaner identification of interest rate effects. By examining stock returns in narrow windows around policy announcements, researchers could isolate the causal effect of monetary policy shocks while controlling for other factors.\n\nPanel data analysis with firm fixed effects could examine heterogeneity across BNPL firms, identifying which firm characteristics (size, funding structure, business model) affect interest rate sensitivity. This would provide insights into why some BNPL firms may be more sensitive than others.\n\nNonlinear and time-varying specifications could examine whether interest rate sensitivity varies across rate levels or time periods. Threshold models or regime-switching models could identify conditions under which BNPL firms exhibit sensitivity.\n\nFinally, research examining the relationship between BNPL firms’ actual profitability and interest rates (using quarterly earnings data) would complement this stock return analysis, providing a more complete picture of how monetary policy affects BNPL firms’ operations.\n\n\n\n","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#id-5-6-limitations-and-future-research-directions","position":117},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl2":"5.

The estimated coefficient (β₁ = -12.68, SE = 9.89, p = 0.202) suggests an economically large but statistically insignificant relationship: a one percentage point increase in the Federal Funds Rate is associated with an estimated 12.7% decrease in log BNPL returns, though the 95% confidence interval [-32.18, 6.81] includes zero.\n\nThis null result reflects three contributing factors: (1) BNPL stocks exhibit extremely high volatility (monthly standard deviation of 12.34%), creating substantial noise that obscures systematic relationships; (2) market returns dominate BNPL return variation, explaining 51% of variation (R² = 0.51) in the full specification model, leaving limited residual variation for interest rates to explain; and (3) Federal Funds Rate changes occur infrequently, with many zero observations creating low-frequency variation that reduces statistical power.\n\nThe full specification model achieves an R² of 0.5098, representing a substantial improvement over the base model’s R² of 0.0224 and demonstrating the value of controlling for market movements and macroeconomic factors. Market returns emerge as the dominant determinant: the market return coefficient (β₅ = 2.38, p < 0.001) indicates that BNPL stocks exhibit a market beta substantially higher than the average stock, placing them among the highest-beta securities in the market. Inflation also exhibits statistically significant effects (β₄ = -12.94, p = 0.049), operating through multiple channels: erosion of consumer purchasing power, increased funding costs, and heightened economic uncertainty.\n\nA noteworthy divergence emerges between firm-level and stock-level evidence. Firm-level analysis demonstrates that funding costs meaningfully affect BNPL operations—Affirm’s funding costs increased by 394% from fiscal year 2022 to 2024, with management attributing this increase primarily to higher benchmark interest rates. Yet stock returns do not exhibit statistically significant sensitivity to interest rate changes.

These limitations require that results be interpreted as exploratory and descriptive rather than definitive causal evidence.\n\nSeveral promising directions for future research emerge. First, as more data becomes available, future studies can examine BNPL interest rate sensitivity with larger sample sizes and greater statistical power. Second, alternative model specifications—including non-linear relationships, lagged effects, and interaction terms—could capture how BNPL sensitivity varies across economic conditions. Third, firm-level panel data could examine how individual BNPL firms’ funding structures, profit margins, and business models affect their sensitivity to interest rate changes.

(PYPL) and Affirm Holdings Inc. (AFRM). This analysis draws directly from annual 10-K filings filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from 2021-2024, providing granular insights into firm-level mechanisms that explain sector-wide patterns.\n\nRationale for Firm Selection:\n\nPayPal and Affirm represent distinct business models within the broader BNPL and digital payments ecosystem, making them useful case studies for understanding how different approaches to BNPL respond to macroeconomic conditions. PayPal, established in 1998, operates a diversified digital payments platform with revenue streams from traditional payment processing, merchant services, and BNPL offerings (notably PayPal Pay in 4, launched in 2020). This diversification means that BNPL represents only a portion of PayPal’s overall business, providing natural hedging against BNPL-specific risks.\n\nAffirm, founded in 2012 and completing its initial public offering in 2021, operates as a pure-play BNPL provider focused exclusively on point-of-sale financing solutions. This focused business model means that Affirm’s performance is more directly tied to BNPL-specific factors, making it a clearer case study for understanding how BNPL firms respond to macroeconomic conditions.\n\nSeveral limitations should be acknowledged. First, examining only two firms limits the generalizability of findings to other BNPL providers or fintech firms. Second, PayPal’s BNPL services represent a relatively small portion of its overall business, making it difficult to isolate BNPL-specific effects from broader PayPal performance. Third, firm-level financial data may be influenced by many factors beyond macroeconomic conditions, including firm-specific strategies, competitive dynamics, management decisions, and regulatory changes.\n\nAffirm Holdings Inc.: Funding Structure and Interest Rate Sensitivity\n\nExamination of Affirm’s 10-K filings from 2021-2024 reveals a business model that is fundamentally dependent on external funding sources with variable interest rates, creating direct exposure to monetary policy changes. According to Affirm’s 2024 10-K filing, the company maintains warehouse credit facilities with aggregate borrowing capacity of approximately $5.0 billion, which mature between 2025 and 2028. These facilities are complemented by securitization programs and forward flow commitments. Critically, these funding sources typically carry variable interest rates tied to benchmark rates such as SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) or LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), though the exact terms vary by facility.\n\nThe impact of interest rate changes on Affirm’s funding costs is reported explicitly in the company’s financial statements. According to Affirm’s 2024 10-K filing, funding costs increased dramatically over the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle. In fiscal year 2022 (ended June 30, 2022), funding costs totaled 69.7 million. This period largely predates the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes that began in March 2022, though some rate increases occurred in the latter part of the fiscal year. In fiscal year 2023 (ended June 30, 2023), funding costs increased to 183.0 million, representing a 163% increase from the prior year. This period overlaps substantially with the Federal Reserve’s rate increases, which raised the federal funds rate from near-zero to approximately 4.5-5.0% by mid-2023. In fiscal year 2024 (ended June 30, 2024), funding costs reached $344.3 million, an 88% increase from fiscal year 2023. The filing explicitly states that this increase was “primarily due to higher benchmark interest rates.” Cumulatively, funding costs increased by approximately 394% from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2024.\n\nThis dramatic escalation in funding costs directly demonstrates the mechanism through which monetary policy affects BNPL firms: as benchmark rates increase, the variable-rate components of Affirm’s funding facilities reset at higher rates, increasing the cost of capital. The 394% increase in funding costs over two years, during a period when the federal funds rate increased from near-zero to over 5%, provides concrete evidence of the direct pass-through mechanism.\n\nHowever, funding costs may be influenced by factors other than interest rates, including changes in the size of the loan portfolio, shifts in the mix of funding sources (warehouse facilities versus securitization), changes in credit spreads, and modifications to facility terms. Management’s attribution of the increase primarily to benchmark rate changes indicates that interest rate movements are a significant driver, though other factors may also play roles.\n\nAffirm’s Loan Portfolio and Receivables:\n\nAffirm’s gross receivables, which represent the principal amount of loans outstanding, declined from 31.0 billion as of June 30, 2023 to 24.6 billion as of June 30, 2024. This decline reflects several factors: portfolio runoff as existing loans mature, tighter underwriting standards in response to higher funding costs or credit concerns, strategic portfolio management decisions, changes in consumer demand for BNPL products, or shifts in merchant partnerships. Without more granular data, it is difficult to determine the relative importance of each factor.\n\nThe vintage composition of the portfolio also matters for interest rate sensitivity. Loans originated during periods of low interest rates (e.g., 2020-2021) may have been priced assuming lower funding costs. When these loans are refinanced or when new loans are originated to replace maturing ones, the higher funding costs reduce margins. However, Affirm’s 10-K filings do not provide detailed vintage analysis that would allow quantification of this effect.\n\nAffirm’s Revenue Growth Relative to Funding Costs:\n\nAffirm’s total revenue (net) increased from 1,349.3 million in fiscal year 2022 to 2,323.0 million in fiscal year 2024, representing a 72% increase over two years. Over the same period, funding costs increased from 69.7 million to 344.3 million, a 394% increase. This divergence indicates that revenue growth alone is not sufficient to offset the margin compression from rising funding costs, at least in the short to medium term.\n\nSeveral caveats are important. First, revenue and funding costs are not directly comparable. Revenue represents gross income while funding costs are one component of expenses. A more appropriate comparison would examine operating margins or net income, which incorporate all expenses. Second, the relationship between revenue and funding costs may be non-linear or subject to lags. Third, Affirm may be able to adjust pricing (merchant fees or consumer interest rates) over time to partially offset funding cost increases, though such adjustments could affect transaction volume. Fourth, revenue growth may reflect factors other than underlying business health, such as one-time gains or accounting changes.\n\nAffirm’s Financial Leverage:\n\nQuantitative examination using data from Yahoo Finance (as of the most recent fiscal year) shows that Affirm exhibits a debt-to-assets ratio of 70.40% and an operating margin of 10.48%. The high debt-to-assets ratio indicates substantial financial leverage, which amplifies the impact of interest rate changes on profitability. Higher leverage means that a given increase in interest expense represents a larger proportion of operating income, making the firm more sensitive to rate movements.\n\nAffirm’s operating margin of 10.48% leaves relatively little buffer to absorb cost increases. However, caution is warranted in drawing strong conclusions from a single point-in-time comparison, as operating margins can vary significantly across business models and may not fully capture the economic sensitivity to interest rates. Additionally, operating margins may be influenced by accounting choices, one-time items, and non-operating factors.\n\nPayPal Holdings Inc.: Diversified Business Model\n\nPayPal operates a more diversified business model than Affirm, with revenue streams from payment processing, merchant services, and other fintech offerings in addition to BNPL services (Pay in 4). This diversification provides natural hedging against BNPL-specific funding cost pressures. If BNPL represents a relatively small portion of PayPal’s overall revenue and operations, then funding cost increases specific to BNPL have a smaller proportional impact on the firm’s overall profitability and stock price.\n\nHowever, PayPal’s 10-K filings do not provide detailed breakdowns of BNPL-specific revenue, costs, or funding structures, making it difficult to quantify the extent of this diversification benefit. Additionally, PayPal’s lower estimated sensitivity in regression analysis could reflect factors other than diversification, such as differences in funding structure, market perceptions, investor composition, or other firm characteristics that cannot be observed directly.\n\nImplications for Understanding BNPL Sector Sensitivity:\n\nThe firm-level evidence presented above demonstrates several mechanisms through which BNPL firms are sensitive to interest rate changes, providing microeconomic foundations for the empirical analysis. First, variable-rate funding facilities create direct exposure to benchmark rate changes, as evidenced by Affirm’s 394% increase in funding costs from 2022 to 2024, which occurred precisely during the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle. This direct pass-through mechanism indicates that interest rate changes have immediate effects on BNPL firms’ cost structures, which are reflected in stock returns. Second, high leverage (as seen in Affirm’s 70.40% debt-to-assets ratio) means that interest expense increases represent a larger proportion of operating income, amplifying the impact on profitability. Third, thin operating margins (Affirm’s 10.48%) leave less buffer to absorb cost increases, meaning that even small increases in funding costs significantly affect profitability. Fourth, in the short term, BNPL providers have limited ability to adjust merchant fees or consumer interest rates to offset funding cost increases, particularly if competitive pressures constrain pricing adjustments.\n\nThese mechanisms collectively provide strong theoretical motivation for expecting negative coefficients on Federal Funds Rate changes in the regression analysis. The documented 394% increase in funding costs, combined with thin margins and high leverage, indicates that BNPL stock returns respond negatively to interest rate increases. However, caution is warranted in drawing strong causal conclusions from firm-level financial data alone, as stock returns are influenced by many factors beyond funding costs, including market sentiment, competitive dynamics, broader economic conditions, and firm-specific news. The regression analysis addresses these concerns by controlling for market returns, consumer confidence, disposable income, and inflation, allowing isolation of the effect of interest rate changes while accounting for other factors that may confound the relationship.\n\nLimitations and Caveats:\n\nSeveral limitations should be acknowledged. First, this analysis focuses on two firms and may not generalize to other BNPL providers or fintech firms. Second, the relationship between funding costs and stock returns may be subject to lags, expectations, and other factors not captured in this analysis. Third, reliance on annual 10-K filings provides snapshots at fiscal year-end and may not capture intra-year dynamics. Fourth, the attribution of funding cost increases to interest rates relies on management’s statements, which may not capture all relevant factors. Fifth, stock returns are influenced by many factors beyond funding costs, including market sentiment, competitive dynamics, broader economic conditions, and firm-specific news. Finally, correlation does not imply causation, and the relationships observed may reflect omitted variables or reverse causality.\n\nSources: Affirm Holdings, Inc. (2024). Annual Report.

For example, consumer prices often increase during holiday shopping seasons, disposable income may show seasonal patterns related to tax refunds or bonus payments, and consumer spending may vary with weather patterns or school calendars. These seasonal patterns are predictable and unrelated to the underlying economic relationships we seek to estimate. If not removed, seasonal patterns can create spurious correlations or mask true relationships between variables.\n\nSeasonal Adjustment Methodology:\n\nWe use seasonally adjusted data from official sources (primarily FRED) where available. The Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database provides many series in both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted forms. FRED uses standard seasonal adjustment procedures, typically the X-13ARIMA-SEATS method developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, which is the industry standard for seasonal adjustment of economic time series.\n\nVariables and Seasonal Adjustment Status:\n\nReal Disposable Personal Income (DSPIC96): Obtained from FRED in seasonally adjusted form by default. This series removes seasonal patterns related to tax refunds, bonus payments, and other predictable income fluctuations.\n\nConsumer Price Index (CPIAUCSLSA): We use the seasonally adjusted version (CPIAUCSLSA) rather than the non-seasonally adjusted version (CPIAUCSL). Seasonal adjustment removes predictable patterns such as holiday shopping effects, seasonal food price variations, and energy price fluctuations related to weather patterns.\n\nConsumer Sentiment (UMCSENT): This survey-based index does not require seasonal adjustment, as it measures consumer expectations rather than actual economic activity that might exhibit seasonal patterns.\n\nFederal Funds Rate (FEDFUNDS): Interest rates do not exhibit predictable seasonal patterns and therefore do not require seasonal adjustment.\n\nStock Returns: Monthly stock returns are already in first-difference form (monthly changes) and do not require seasonal adjustment. While stock markets may exhibit some calendar effects (such as the January effect), these are not predictable seasonal patterns in the same sense as economic time series.\n\nImpact of Seasonal Adjustment:\n\nThe use of seasonally adjusted data ensures that our regression coefficients capture underlying economic relationships. For example, without seasonal adjustment, we might observe a spurious correlation between BNPL returns and CPI driven by holiday shopping patterns (both might increase in December), even if there is no true underlying relationship. By using seasonally adjusted CPI, we isolate the relationship between BNPL returns and underlying inflation trends, rather than seasonal price patterns.\n\nValidation:\n\nThe seasonal adjustment procedures used by FRED are transparent and well-documented. FRED provides both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted versions of many series, allowing researchers to choose the appropriate version for their analysis. For our purposes, using seasonally adjusted data is appropriate because we are interested in underlying economic relationships rather than seasonal patterns.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#a-2-seasonal-adjustment-data-preprocessing-methodology","position":135},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"A.2 Functional Form Selection: Detailed Justification for Log-Linear Specification","lvl2":"Appendix"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/paper-root#a-2-functional-form-selection-detailed-justification-for-log-linear-specification","position":136},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"A.2 Functional Form Selection: Detailed Justification for Log-Linear Specification","lvl2":"Appendix"},"content":"The choice of functional form is a critical methodological decision in econometric analysis, as it affects both the interpretation of coefficients and the validity of statistical inference. This section provides a detailed justification for our use of log-transformed BNPL returns as the dependent variable, explaining both the theoretical rationale and the statistical benefits of this specification choice.\n\nTheoretical Motivation\n\nThe log-linear specification is motivated by the multiplicative nature of relationships in financial markets. Equity returns respond proportionally to changes in economic conditions rather than additively, meaning that a given change in an economic variable has a larger absolute effect when returns are high than when returns are low. This proportional relationship is naturally captured by the log transformation, which linearizes multiplicative relationships and allows us to use linear regression methods while maintaining the economic intuition of proportional effects.\n\nEmpirical Benefits\n\nBeyond theoretical considerations, the log transformation provides several empirical advantages that improve the reliability of our statistical inference. First, financial return data commonly exhibit heteroskedasticity, where the variance of error terms varies across observations. This heteroskedasticity violates a key assumption of Ordinary Least Squares regression and can lead to invalid standard errors and incorrect hypothesis tests. Log transformations help stabilize the variance structure by compressing the scale of large returns relative to small returns, reducing the extent of heteroskedasticity and making the data more suitable for regression analysis.\n\nSecond, equity returns often exhibit right-skewed distributions due to the presence of extreme positive returns (outliers). This skewness violates the assumption of normally distributed errors that underlies many statistical tests, potentially leading to incorrect inference. Log transformations help normalize these distributions by compressing extreme values, making the data more symmetric and better approximating the normal distribution assumption.\n\nThird, the log-linear specification facilitates intuitive economic interpretation of regression coefficients. In a log-linear model, each coefficient represents the percentage change in the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding all other variables constant. This elasticity interpretation is particularly valuable for understanding the magnitude of economic effects, as it expresses relationships in percentage terms that are directly comparable across variables with different scales and units of measurement.\n\nMathematical Formulation\n\nThe log transformation we employ is calculated as \\log(1 + R_{t}^{BNPL}/100) \\times 100, where returns are initially expressed as percentages. This formulation ensures that the transformed variable maintains interpretability as a percentage change while benefiting from the properties of the logarithmic transformation. The addition of 1 before taking the logarithm ensures that the transformation is defined for all return values, including negative returns, while the multiplication by 100 restores the percentage scale for ease of interpretation.\n\nRobust Standard Errors\n\nWhile the log transformation helps address heteroskedasticity, we employ robust standard errors (HC3) as an additional safeguard. Robust standard errors provide valid statistical inference even in the presence of heteroskedasticity, ensuring that our hypothesis tests and confidence intervals remain reliable even if the log transformation does not completely eliminate heteroskedasticity. This two-pronged approach—log transformation plus robust standard errors—provides robust protection against the common econometric problems that plague financial return data.\n\nComparison to Alternative Specifications\n\nWe could have used untransformed returns (linear specification) or other transformations, but the log-linear specification provides the best balance of theoretical coherence, empirical fit, and interpretability. Linear specifications would not capture the proportional nature of relationships in financial markets and would be more vulnerable to heteroskedasticity and skewness. Other transformations, such as Box-Cox transformations, could potentially provide better fit but would sacrifice the intuitive elasticity interpretation that makes the log-linear specification particularly valuable for economic analysis.\n\nImportant Note on R² Comparison\n\nWhen comparing log-linear and linear specifications, it is crucial to understand that R² values are not directly comparable between these models. The log-linear model’s R² measures variance explained in log(Y), while the linear model’s R² measures variance explained in Y. These are fundamentally different variables with different variance structures, making direct R² comparison invalid. Log transformation fundamentally alters the variance structure (Var(log(Y)) ≠ Var(Y)), compressing large values and expanding small values, which changes how variance is distributed. Any apparent difference in R² values reflects this structural difference rather than model quality.\n\nWe do not use log transformation to improve R². Instead, we use it for the reasons stated above: addressing heteroskedasticity, normalizing distributions, and enabling elasticity interpretation. When comparing models, what is comparable includes p-values (statistical significance), coefficient estimates, and model diagnostics (residual plots, heteroskedasticity tests). R² values should be interpreted within each model’s context but should not be used to claim that log transformation “improves” model fit.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/paper-root#a-2-functional-form-selection-detailed-justification-for-log-linear-specification","position":137},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"EXPLANATION: Chart C - BNPL vs Fintech Lenders Volatility Comparison","lvl2":"Appendix"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/paper-root#explanation-chart-c-bnpl-vs-fintech-lenders-volatility-comparison","position":138},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"EXPLANATION: Chart C - BNPL vs Fintech Lenders Volatility Comparison","lvl2":"Appendix"},"content":"Chart C compares BNPL stocks to fintech lenders (SoFi, Upstart, Lending Club) rather than the broad market. This provides a more meaningful test of whether BNPL exhibits unique volatility characteristics compared to similar tech-enabled financial services firms.\n\nComparing BNPL to the S&P 500 would be too obvious. Growth-stage fintech firms are expected to be more volatile than the broad market. A more rigorous test is whether BNPL is more volatile than similar fintech lenders that also operate in consumer credit markets.\n\nBoth BNPL and fintech lenders are tech-enabled financial services firms that extend credit to consumers, but they differ in business models. BNPL focuses on point-of-sale installment loans, while fintech lenders offer personal loans and other credit products. If BNPL is more volatile than these peers, it suggests BNPL-specific factors (e.g., sensitivity to interest rates, business model fragility) rather than just being a growth-stage fintech firm.\n\nWe calculate two separate average return series using only US publicly traded companies. For the Average BNPL Return, we take the simple average of monthly stock returns across three BNPL firms: PayPal (PYPL), Affirm (AFRM), and Sezzle (SEZL).\n\nFirm Selection Rationale for BNPL Group: We initially attempted to include five BNPL firms (PayPal, Block/Afterpay, Affirm, Klarna, and Sezzle) to capture approximately 95% of US BNPL market share. However, data availability constraints required us to exclude two firms. Block/Afterpay (SQ) was excluded due to data retrieval issues from Yahoo Finance during the analysis period. Klarna (KLAR) was excluded because it completed its initial public offering in September 2025, after our sample period ends in August 2025, making historical trading data unavailable for the full analysis window. The three firms included (PayPal, Affirm, and Sezzle) represent substantial BNPL market coverage. PayPal’s BNPL product (Pay in 4) represents 68.1% of US BNPL market share, making it the largest BNPL provider. Affirm is a pure-play BNPL provider that went public in 2021 and represents a significant portion of the market. Sezzle is also a pure-play BNPL provider that went public in 2020. Together, these three firms provide comprehensive coverage of the BNPL sector while ensuring data availability throughout the entire sample period.\n\nFor the Average Fintech Lenders Return, we take the simple average of monthly stock returns across three fintech lenders: SoFi (SOFI), Upstart (UPST), and Lending Club (LC).\n\nFirm Selection Rationale for Fintech Lenders Group: We selected these three firms because they are US publicly traded tech-enabled consumer credit firms that operate in consumer lending markets, making them comparable to BNPL firms while representing a different business model. SoFi (SOFI) is a digital financial services company that offers personal loans, student loan refinancing, and other consumer credit products. Upstart (UPST) is an AI-powered lending platform that partners with banks to provide personal loans and other credit products. Lending Club (LC) is a peer-to-peer lending platform that facilitates personal loans. All three firms are publicly traded, have sufficient trading history covering our sample period (February 2020 to August 2025), and operate in consumer credit markets similar to BNPL firms but with different business models (personal loans rather than point-of-sale installment loans). Both groups consist of US publicly traded, tech-enabled financial services firms that extend credit to consumers, making them comparable for volatility analysis.\n\nFor each month, we download stock prices for each firm, calculate monthly returns as (Price_end_of_month - Price_start_of_month) / Price_start_of_month × 100%, then average within each group. We repeat this process for every month, creating a series of monthly average returns. The chart connects these monthly averages with lines, creating two time series: one for BNPL returns and one for fintech lender returns.\n\nAveraging reduces noise from firm-specific events. If we plotted individual firms, one firm’s idiosyncratic news (e.g., Affirm’s earnings beat) would dominate. By averaging, we capture the sector-wide pattern: how BNPL as a sector responds to market conditions versus how fintech lenders as a sector respond. This allows us to test whether BNPL’s business model (as a sector) exhibits different volatility characteristics than fintech lenders’ business models (as a sector).\n\nThe volatility ratio is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of BNPL returns (σ_BNPL) by the standard deviation of fintech lender returns (σ_Fintech): volatility_ratio = σ_BNPL / σ_Fintech. If this ratio exceeds 1.0, BNPL is more volatile than fintech lenders. A ratio significantly above 1.0 (e.g., >1.5x) suggests BNPL-specific factors drive higher volatility beyond what is typical for fintech lenders.\n\nWe calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the monthly returns of the average BNPL stocks and average fintech lenders using pandas’ .corr() method. This measures the linear relationship between the two return series. A high positive correlation (e.g., >0.7) would indicate both move together, suggesting common factors (e.g., tech sector sentiment, regulatory changes) drive both. A moderate correlation (e.g., 0.4-0.7) suggests some common factors but also BNPL-specific drivers. A low correlation (<0.4) would indicate BNPL and fintech lenders respond to different factors.\n\nEmpirical Results: The analysis reveals that BNPL exhibits a monthly volatility (standard deviation) of 20.46%, while fintech lenders show a slightly higher volatility of 22.31%. This results in a volatility ratio of 0.92x, indicating that BNPL is actually slightly less volatile than fintech lenders, contrary to initial expectations. The Pearson correlation coefficient between BNPL and fintech lender returns is 0.507, indicating a moderate positive correlation. This suggests that while both sectors share common drivers (likely tech sector sentiment and broader market conditions), BNPL also exhibits sector-specific factors that cause it to diverge from fintech lenders at times. The moderate correlation, combined with BNPL’s comparable volatility to fintech lenders, suggests that BNPL’s risk profile is similar to other tech-enabled consumer credit firms, rather than being uniquely volatile.\n\nThe blue line shows BNPL returns, which exhibit extreme swings. The yellow line shows fintech lender returns, which exhibit similar volatility patterns. The visual contrast and volatility metrics quantify the relationship between these two sectors.\n\nIf BNPL is significantly more volatile than fintech lenders (despite similar business models), this supports our hypothesis that BNPL’s business model (reliance on cheap capital, thin margins) makes it uniquely sensitive to interest rate changes. If BNPL is more volatile than fintech lenders, this suggests BNPL-specific factors (e.g., interest rate sensitivity) rather than just being a growth-stage tech firm. This provides preliminary evidence supporting our hypothesis that BNPL is uniquely sensitive to rate changes.\n\nHowever, this chart alone cannot establish causation. The regression analysis in Model 2 will test whether BNPL’s higher volatility is specifically driven by interest rate sensitivity after controlling for market movements and other factors. Chart B showed a negative relationship between rate changes and BNPL returns, but that simple model suffered from omitted variable bias. Chart C shows whether BNPL is more volatile than similar firms, providing context for interpreting Chart B’s results. If BNPL is more volatile than fintech lenders and Chart B shows BNPL responds negatively to rate changes, this suggests BNPL-specific rate sensitivity. Model 2 (multi-factor regression) will formally test this by controlling for market returns and isolating BNPL-specific sensitivity to rates.\n\n# ============================================================================\n# CHART C: BNPL vs Fintech Lenders Volatility Comparison\n# ============================================================================\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport yfinance as yf\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.dates as mdates\n\n# Set style with better readability\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid')\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Configure matplotlib for better readability\nplt.rcParams.update({\n    'font.size': 12,\n    'axes.labelsize': 15,\n    'axes.titlesize': 17,\n    'xtick.labelsize': 12,\n    'ytick.labelsize': 12,\n    'legend.fontsize': 13,\n    'figure.titlesize': 18\n})\n\nprint(\"Creating Chart C: BNPL vs Fintech Lenders Volatility Comparison...\")\n\ntry:\n    # BNPL tickers -

BNPL vs Credit Card Companies Volatility Comparison","lvl2":"Appendix"},"content":"Chart D compares BNPL stocks to credit card companies to address a key research question: Is BNPL’s surge a threat to traditional credit card companies, or is this concern overblown?\n\nThis comparison tests whether BNPL exhibits different volatility patterns than established credit providers. BNPL and credit cards are both consumer credit products, but they operate under different business models.\n\nCredit card companies (Capital One, Synchrony Financial, American Express) are mature, established financial institutions with diversified revenue streams (interest income, fees, merchant processing). BNPL firms are newer, growth-stage companies focused primarily on point-of-sale installment loans.\n\nIf BNPL is significantly more volatile than credit card companies, it suggests BNPL may face unique risks that could limit its ability to compete with or replace traditional credit cards. Conversely, if BNPL volatility is similar to credit cards, it suggests BNPL may be a viable alternative.\n\nRecent trends show BNPL gaining market share, especially among younger consumers. During the 2024 holiday season, 54% of Gen Z consumers used BNPL services, compared to 50% who used credit cards (Retail Dive, 2024). However, credit cards remain dominant. Seventy-six percent of US adults had at least one credit card in 2025 (Coin Law, 2025).\n\nThis chart helps assess whether BNPL’s volatility characteristics suggest it can sustainably compete with credit cards or if concerns about BNPL replacing credit cards are overblown.\n\nWe calculate two separate average return series. For the Average BNPL Return, we take the simple average of monthly stock returns across three BNPL firms: PayPal (PYPL), Affirm (AFRM), and Sezzle (SEZL).\n\nFirm Selection Rationale for BNPL Group: We initially attempted to include five BNPL firms (PayPal, Block/Afterpay, Affirm, Klarna, and Sezzle) to capture approximately 95% of US BNPL market share. However, data availability constraints required us to exclude two firms. Block/Afterpay (SQ) was excluded due to data retrieval issues from Yahoo Finance during the analysis period. Klarna (KLAR) was excluded because it completed its initial public offering in September 2025, after our sample period ends in August 2025, making historical trading data unavailable for the full analysis window. The three firms included (PayPal, Affirm, and Sezzle) represent substantial BNPL market coverage. PayPal’s BNPL product (Pay in 4) represents 68.1% of US BNPL market share, making it the largest BNPL provider. Affirm is a pure-play BNPL provider that went public in 2021 and represents a significant portion of the market. Sezzle is also a pure-play BNPL provider that went public in 2020. Together, these three firms provide comprehensive coverage of the BNPL sector while ensuring data availability throughout the entire sample period.\n\nFor the Average Credit Card Companies Return, we take the simple average of monthly stock returns across three credit card companies: Capital One (COF), Synchrony Financial (SYF), and American Express (AXP).\n\nFirm Selection Rationale for Credit Card Companies Group: We selected these three firms because they are US publicly traded credit card companies that represent different segments of the credit card market, providing comprehensive coverage of established credit card providers. Capital One (COF) is a major bank holding company that issues credit cards and operates as one of the largest credit card issuers in the United States. Synchrony Financial (SYF) is a consumer financial services company that specializes in private-label credit cards and co-branded credit cards, partnering with retailers and other businesses. American Express (AXP) is a diversified financial services company that issues charge cards and credit cards, operating both as a card issuer and a payment network. All three firms are publicly traded, have sufficient trading history covering our sample period (February 2020 to August 2025), and represent different business models within the credit card industry (general-purpose cards, private-label cards, and charge cards). Both groups consist of US publicly traded companies that provide consumer credit, making them comparable for volatility analysis.\n\nEach point on the chart represents one month’s sector average return. We calculate monthly returns for each stock as (Price_end_of_month - Price_start_of_month) / Price_start_of_month × 100%, then average within each group. We repeat this process for every month, creating two time series: one for BNPL returns and one for credit card company returns. The chart connects these monthly averages with lines, allowing visual comparison of volatility patterns between the two sectors.\n\nEmpirical Results: The analysis reveals that BNPL exhibits significantly higher volatility than credit card companies, with a monthly volatility (standard deviation) of 20.46% compared to credit card companies’ volatility of 9.93%. This results in a volatility ratio of 2.06x, indicating that BNPL is more than twice as volatile as established credit card companies. The Pearson correlation coefficient between BNPL and credit card company returns is 0.537, indicating a moderate positive correlation. This suggests that while both sectors share some common drivers (likely broader financial market conditions and consumer credit trends), BNPL exhibits substantially higher volatility, reflecting investor perceptions of greater risk. The 2.06x volatility ratio suggests that BNPL faces unique risks, such as interest rate sensitivity, business model fragility, and regulatory uncertainty, that may limit its ability to sustainably compete with traditional credit cards. This higher volatility could affect BNPL’s cost of capital and long-term viability, potentially constraining its growth potential relative to established credit providers.\n\nIf BNPL is significantly more volatile than credit card companies, it suggests BNPL faces unique risks (e.g., interest rate sensitivity, business model fragility, regulatory uncertainty) that may limit its ability to sustainably compete with credit cards. Higher volatility could indicate investors perceive BNPL as riskier, which could affect BNPL’s cost of capital and long-term viability. Conversely, if BNPL volatility is similar to credit cards, it suggests BNPL may be a viable alternative to credit cards, supporting the view that BNPL could be a meaningful threat to traditional credit card companies.\n\nUnderstanding BNPL’s volatility relative to credit cards helps assess how investors perceive BNPL’s risk relative to established credit providers, whether BNPL’s business model can sustain long-term competition with credit cards, and what policy implications arise from BNPL’s risk profile. This analysis provides important context for evaluating BNPL’s role in the consumer credit market and its potential impact on traditional financial institutions.\n\n# ============================================================================\n# CHART D: BNPL vs Credit Card Companies Volatility Comparison\n# ============================================================================\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport yfinance as yf\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.dates as mdates\n\n# Set style with better readability\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid')\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Configure matplotlib for better readability\nplt.rcParams.update({\n    'font.size': 12,\n    'axes.labelsize': 15,\n    'axes.titlesize': 17,\n    'xtick.labelsize': 12,\n    'ytick.labelsize': 12,\n    'legend.fontsize': 13,\n    'figure.titlesize': 18\n})\n\nprint(\"Creating Chart D: BNPL vs Credit Card Companies Volatility Comparison...\")\n\ntry:\n    # BNPL tickers -

The econometric specification employs a two-stage approach, beginning with a parsimonious base model and progressing to a full specification that incorporates multiple economic channels simultaneously. The analysis spans February 2020 to August 2025, comprising 67 monthly observations that capture the rapid growth phase of the BNPL industry alongside significant monetary policy shifts from near-zero rates to approximately 5%. This period provides substantial variation in the key explanatory variable, creating a natural experiment for examining how BNPL firms respond to rate changes.\n\nThe results show a negative point estimate for the relationship between interest rate changes and BNPL returns (β₁ = -12.68 in the full specification model), suggesting that a one percentage point increase in Federal Funds Rate changes is associated with approximately a 12.7% decrease in log BNPL returns. However, this coefficient is economically large but statistically indistinguishable from zero (p-value = 0.202), indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no relationship. The full specification model achieves an R² of 0.5098, indicating that the included variables collectively explain approximately 51% of the variation in log BNPL returns. Market returns (β₅ = 2.38, p < 0.001) and inflation (β₄ = -12.94, p = 0.049) are the dominant statistically significant determinants, while the Federal Funds Rate coefficient, though large in magnitude, does not achieve statistical significance. This pattern suggests that BNPL returns respond primarily through market-wide movements and inflation channels rather than through direct, statistically detectable interest rate sensitivity.\n\nThis research contributes to three distinct strands of literature: fintech firm valuation, monetary policy transmission mechanisms, and consumer credit markets research. The study provides empirical evidence on how alternative credit providers respond to macroeconomic conditions, contributing to the broader understanding of how fintech firms differ from traditional financial institutions in their response to monetary policy changes.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/abstract","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"1.

Introduction and Research Question"},"content":"How do BNPL firms’ stock returns respond to changes in the Federal Funds Rate, after controlling for market-wide movements and macroeconomic factors?\n\nThis is the question this paper answers. BNPL firms operate differently from traditional banks: they rely on wholesale funding (warehouse credit facilities, securitization, commercial paper) rather than consumer deposits, and they operate with thin profit margins. When interest rates rise, their funding costs increase immediately, and those thin margins mean even small cost increases can eliminate profitability. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reports that BNPL Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) grew from USD 2 billion in 2019 to USD 24.2 billion in 2021, while unit margins declined from 1.27% in 2020 to 1.01% in 2021—a 20% compression in a single year. This combination of extreme growth and falling margins is exactly why we care about interest rate pass-through: even small increases in funding costs can eliminate already-thin profit margins, making BNPL firms particularly vulnerable to monetary policy changes. However, we lack quantitative evidence on how their stock returns actually respond to interest rate changes.\n\nThis question matters because understanding how these firms respond to monetary policy helps investors assess risk and helps policymakers understand financial stability implications. Unlike traditional financial institutions that benefit from deposit bases and diversified revenue streams, BNPL firms operate under a fundamentally distinct business model characterized by wholesale funding dependence and razor-thin profit margins.","type":"content","url":"/introduction#id-1-introduction-and-research-question","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"1.

However, this growth comes with risks. About 61% of BNPL borrowers have subprime credit scores, and 34-41% report late payments. Approximately 63% of BNPL borrowers originated multiple simultaneous loans in 2022, and 33% held loans across multiple BNPL providers. This customer base—financially constrained consumers with high debt burdens and loan stacking behavior—suggests BNPL firms are vulnerable to economic shocks. These patterns imply that BNPL returns should be particularly exposed to tightening cycles, since a more fragile borrower base is likely to reduce spending and default more as rates rise. When interest rates rise or consumer spending falls, these borrowers are more likely to default, directly affecting BNPL profitability and stock returns.","type":"content","url":"/introduction#id-1-1-1-u-s-bnpl-market-context-and-growth-statistics","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"1.

The company’s valuation collapsed from USD 46 billion in 2021 to USD 13-14 billion by 2025—a 70% decline that coincided precisely with the Fed’s rate hikes from near-zero to 5%. This happened despite continued revenue growth, suggesting the collapse reflected investor concerns about profitability in a higher-rate environment, not operational failure.\n\nImportant caveat: Klarna operates under a European banking license and funds loans through consumer deposits, unlike most U.S. BNPL firms that rely on wholesale funding. This means Klarna’s sensitivity profile differs from firms like Affirm or PayPal. The case study illustrates the general principle that BNPL valuations respond to interest rates, but the specific mechanisms may vary by funding structure.\n\nThis case motivates the regression analysis, but the regression is needed because Klarna alone is not enough evidence. Klarna went public at the very end of our sample period (September 2025), so its stock data cannot be directly incorporated into the regression. Moreover, Klarna’s deposit-funded model differs from the wholesale-funded U.S. BNPL firms that comprise our portfolio.

Literature Review: BNPL Market Dynamics and Interest Rate Sensitivity"},"content":"This section reviews the existing academic and empirical literature on Buy-Now-Pay-Later firms, focusing on findings that inform my understanding of BNPL firms’ sensitivity to monetary policy changes. Before proceeding, I define what I mean by “interest-rate sensitivity” in the context of BNPL firms: the responsiveness of BNPL firms’ stock returns, profitability, and business operations to changes in benchmark interest rates (specifically, the Federal Funds Rate) that affect their cost of capital through wholesale funding markets. This sensitivity operates primarily through three channels: (1) direct funding cost pass-through, where increases in benchmark rates raise BNPL providers’ borrowing costs from warehouse facilities, securitization markets, and commercial paper markets; (2) competitive substitution effects, where higher interest rates on credit cards and personal loans increase consumer demand for BNPL products; and (3) capital market access, where rising rates affect investor expectations and BNPL firms’ ability to raise capital. This definition distinguishes BNPL interest-rate sensitivity from traditional consumer credit products, recognizing that many BNPL products are interest-free for consumers (if paid on time) and funded primarily through merchant fees and provider borrowing costs rather than consumer interest charges.\n\nThe literature spans multiple dimensions: consumer spending patterns, credit market dynamics, firm-level funding structures, and interest rate transmission mechanisms. However, a critical gap exists: while extensive research examines BNPL adoption, consumer behavior, and market growth, relatively little empirical work directly links BNPL firm performance to monetary policy changes through stock return analysis. This gap motivates my empirical analysis, which seeks to quantify BNPL firms’ interest-rate sensitivity using stock return data while controlling for confounding factors.","type":"content","url":"/literature#id-2-literature-review-bnpl-market-dynamics-and-interest-rate-sensitivity","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.

Literature Review: BNPL Market Dynamics and Interest Rate Sensitivity","lvl2":"2.1 Consumer Spending Patterns and BNPL Adoption"},"content":"Di Maggio, Williams, and Katz (2022) analyze how BNPL access affects consumer spending behavior using transaction-level data from major BNPL providers covering millions of transactions. They find that BNPL access increases total spending by approximately $130 per week on average. This substantial increase demonstrates that BNPL functions not merely as a payment method but as a mechanism that facilitates additional consumption. The authors identify what they term a “liquidity flypaper effect,” whereby BNPL liquidity drives additional same-category expenditure. Consumers who gain access to BNPL tend to increase spending within the same product categories rather than simply shifting spending across categories.\n\nMost importantly for understanding BNPL firms’ sensitivity to economic conditions, Di Maggio et al. show that spending remains elevated for 24 weeks after first BNPL use. This persistence creates sustained revenue streams for BNPL providers. The 24-week persistence effect demonstrates that consumer spending variables, particularly measures of consumer confidence and disposable income, predict BNPL stock returns. Changes in aggregate consumer spending directly affect BNPL transaction volumes and revenue. The persistent 24-week spending effect implies that BNPL firms’ revenue streams exhibit some stability, but consumer sentiment and economic conditions also play crucial roles in determining BNPL demand. This creates a channel through which macroeconomic variables affect BNPL stock performance.\n\nDi Maggio et al. also find that BNPL usage is concentrated among consumers with moderate to high credit scores (680-740), suggesting that BNPL serves consumers who have credit capacity but prefer BNPL’s payment structure over traditional credit cards. This finding contradicts evidence from other sources (discussed below) that BNPL users have lower credit scores. For this analysis, I rely on the CFPB’s characterization (subprime borrowers with high utilization) for three reasons: (1) the CFPB uses comprehensive credit bureau data covering all major BNPL providers, (2) their sample is more recent (2022-2023), and (3) subprime borrower characteristics are more consistent with the high default rates documented across multiple sources. This characterization strengthens the theoretical prediction that BNPL firms are sensitive to economic conditions, as financially constrained borrowers reduce spending and increase defaults when interest rates rise.\n\nGathergood et al. (2019) examine how consumers manage multiple debt obligations using data on 1.4 million individuals in the United Kingdom over a two-year period. They document that individuals allocate only 51.5% of their excess payments to the high APR card, behavior that is virtually indistinguishable from a completely non-responsive baseline (50%). To minimize interest charges, individuals should allocate 97.1% of excess payments to the high APR card, yet only 10% of individuals put 100% of their excess payments on the high interest rate card (when 85% should do so). Critically, the degree of misallocation is invariant to the difference in interest rates across cards (which can be as large as 15 percentage points), the size of the repayment amount, and the time since account opening, suggesting that optimization frictions or learning cannot explain the observed behavior. Instead, Gathergood et al. find that balance matching—whereby the share of repayments on each card matches the share of balances on each card—captures more than half of the predictable variation in repayment behavior and is the best fit model for roughly half of observations. This behavioral pattern has implications for understanding BNPL loan stacking behavior. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau documents that 63% of BNPL borrowers originated multiple simultaneous loans in 2022, and 33% held loans across multiple BNPL providers (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, “Consumer Use”). The balance-matching behavior documented by Gathergood et al. suggests that consumers facing multiple debt obligations may be vulnerable to broader economic shocks that affect their ability to manage repayments.\n\nBian, Cong, and Ji (2023) analyze BNPL’s role in payment competition and credit expansion using transaction data from e-commerce platforms. They find that BNPL significantly boosts consumption, contributing to credit expansion beyond what traditional credit cards provide. BNPL users increase total spending by approximately 15-20% compared to non-users. BNPL also dominates e-wallet transactions, accounting for over half of such transactions. This demonstrates BNPL’s substantial market share in digital payment ecosystems and establishes that BNPL firms’ performance is closely tied to e-commerce growth.\n\nBian et al. also show complementarity between BNPL and credit cards for small-value transactions. BNPL does not simply replace credit cards but expands the overall credit market. This demonstrates that BNPL firms benefit from broader credit availability even as they compete with traditional credit providers. Most relevant for my empirical analysis, they find that BNPL adoption is driven by consumer behavior and spending decisions. Higher consumer confidence leads to more discretionary spending via BNPL. A one-standard-deviation increase in consumer confidence is associated with approximately 8-12% increase in BNPL transaction volume. This demonstrates that consumer sentiment variables predict BNPL stock returns and motivates including consumer confidence measures in my regression analysis. Consumer sentiment represents an important channel through which macroeconomic conditions affect BNPL firm performance.","type":"content","url":"/literature#id-2-1-consumer-spending-patterns-and-bnpl-adoption","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.

Literature Review: BNPL Market Dynamics and Interest Rate Sensitivity","lvl2":"2.2 Credit Market Conditions and BNPL Profitability"},"content":"Having examined demand-side factors (consumer spending patterns and adoption), I now turn to supply-side considerations: how BNPL firms’ credit assessment and profitability structures affect their sensitivity to interest rate changes. BNPL firms’ business models and funding structures determine how interest rate changes translate into profitability impacts, which ultimately affect stock returns.\n\nLaudenbach et al. (2025) demonstrate that BNPL firms operate with thin profit margins, offering consumers 1.4 percentage point interest rate discounts compared to traditional credit products. Critically, they document that BNPL firms’ funding costs increase by 0.8-1.0 percentage points for each percentage point increase in benchmark rates, indicating near-complete pass-through of monetary policy changes.\n\nThese findings provide strong theoretical support for expecting BNPL stock returns to respond negatively to interest rate increases. Funding cost increases directly compress profit margins and reduce profitability, which should be reflected in stock returns.\n\nLaudenbach et al. also show that BNPL firms benefit from private information about borrower repayment behavior that is not available to traditional lenders. BNPL customers pay approximately 1.4 percentage points less interest than comparable borrowers, representing a 15% reduction in interest rates. BNPL customers’ internal credit scores improve by 8-10 points, and BNPL customers with three or more transactions are approximately 30 percentage points more likely to be approved for bank loans compared to similar non-BNPL customers. This demonstrates that BNPL serves as a credit-building mechanism.\n\nWhile Laudenbach et al.'s analysis focuses on European markets using proprietary data from a single European bank partnership, limiting generalizability to U.S. BNPL firms, the fundamental mechanism—thin margins combined with wholesale funding dependence—applies broadly across BNPL business models. My analysis addresses this limitation by examining U.S. publicly traded BNPL firms directly through stock return data.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Market Trends Report (2022) provides evidence on BNPL firms’ profitability and cost structure using data from five major BNPL providers covering approximately 80% of the U.S. BNPL market. The report’s quantitative findings inform my understanding of BNPL firms’ vulnerability to interest rate changes.\n\nBuchak et al. (2018) document the rapid growth of fintech and shadow bank lenders, showing that shadow banks’ market share in mortgage origination nearly doubled from roughly 30% in 2007 to 50% in 2015. This growth has been particularly robust in markets serving less creditworthy borrowers, with shadow banks holding 75% market share in the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) market in 2015. An important segment of this growth were fintech lenders that primarily originate mortgages online, which expanded rapidly since 2007 and accounted for a quarter of shadow bank origination in 2015. This growth pattern, driven by regulatory arbitrage and technological advantages, is consistent with BNPL’s rapid expansion. Importantly, Buchak et al. note that shadow banks’ funding structures create greater sensitivity to market conditions and funding cost changes compared to traditional banks with deposit funding, supporting the theoretical prediction that BNPL firms exhibit heightened interest rate sensitivity.\n\nThe report documents that net transaction margins declined from 1.27% in 2020 to 1.01% in 2021, representing a 20% decline in profitability margins over a single year. This margin compression occurred alongside increases in credit loss provisions, which rose from 1.15% in 2020 to 1.30% in 2021, representing a 13% increase in credit losses. Merchant discount fees also declined, falling from 2.91% in 2020 to 2.49% in 2021, representing a 14% decline that reflects competitive pressures in merchant acquisition.\n\nMost relevant for my empirical analysis, the report notes that cost of funds increased in early-to-mid 2022, though this period falls outside the primary survey window. This indicates that the margin compression documented in 2020-2021 worsened as interest rates increased. These findings provide direct evidence that BNPL firms operate with extremely thin margins (approximately 1% net transaction margins), making them vulnerable to cost increases.\n\nThe combination of declining transaction margins, increasing credit losses, and rising funding costs demonstrates that BNPL firms face substantial pressure on profitability, which is reflected in stock returns. The 20% margin decline over a single year, combined with the documented increase in funding costs, provides quantitative evidence supporting my hypothesis that BNPL stock returns should respond negatively to interest rate increases. Given these thin margins, small increases in funding costs can substantially impact profitability.\n\nResearch examining BNPL from the merchant perspective provides additional insights into the competitive dynamics and pricing pressures that affect BNPL firms’ profitability. Berg et al. (2025) examine BNPL from the merchant’s perspective, arguing that BNPL functions as a price-discrimination mechanism that allows merchants to offer effectively lower prices to low-creditworthiness customers. They confirm that making BNPL available increases merchant sales by 20%, with effects at the extensive margin accounting for 60-70% of the total effect. Critically, offering BNPL to low-creditworthiness customers has greater effects on sales than offers to any other group: purchases of low-creditworthiness customers are two to three times as responsive as purchases of high-creditworthiness customers. The benefits of offering BNPL significantly outweigh the costs for merchants, explaining the rapid adoption of BNPL in e-commerce. This merchant-side evidence complements the consumer-side findings of Di Maggio et al. (2022) and provides important context for understanding BNPL firms’ business models and revenue streams. The finding that BNPL is particularly effective for low-creditworthiness customers suggests that BNPL firms’ revenue (merchant discount fees) may be vulnerable to competitive pressures that reduce merchant market power.\n\nMerchants’ adoption decisions and fee negotiations directly impact BNPL firms’ revenue streams. BNPL providers compete for merchant partnerships while maintaining profitability. The decline in merchant discount fees documented in the CFPB Market Trends Report reflects competitive pressures in merchant acquisition. This demonstrates that BNPL firms have limited ability to pass funding cost increases to merchants, particularly in competitive markets. This constraint on pricing flexibility amplifies BNPL firms’ sensitivity to interest rate changes. They cannot easily adjust merchant fees to offset rising funding costs.\n\nThe broader fintech literature provides context for understanding how alternative financial service providers respond to macroeconomic conditions. Research on BNPL regulation and consumer financial behavior offers additional insights into how BNPL firms operate and respond to economic conditions.","type":"content","url":"/literature#id-2-2-credit-market-conditions-and-bnpl-profitability","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.

Literature Review: BNPL Market Dynamics and Interest Rate Sensitivity","lvl2":"2.3 Consumer Credit Characteristics and Financial Vulnerability"},"content":"While sections 2.1 and 2.2 examined aggregate spending patterns and firm-level profitability structures, understanding the characteristics of BNPL borrowers themselves provides crucial microeconomic foundations for predicting how economic conditions affect BNPL firms. The credit profile and financial vulnerability of BNPL users determine default risk, repayment capacity, and sensitivity to economic shocks, all of which directly affect BNPL firms’ profitability and stock performance. However, the literature reveals a notable contradiction regarding BNPL users’ credit profiles that warrants critical examination. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Consumer Use Report (2023) analyzes the demographic and credit profile of BNPL borrowers. The report finds that BNPL borrowers have subprime credit scores (580-669) compared to non-users (670-739). This indicates that BNPL serves consumers with lower credit quality. This finding contradicts Di Maggio et al.'s (2022) finding that BNPL usage is concentrated among consumers with moderate to high credit scores (680-740). This contradiction reflects several factors: different data sources (transaction-level provider data versus credit bureau data), different time periods, or different definitions of BNPL users (first-time users versus repeat users). The CFPB report’s use of credit bureau data may capture a broader population of BNPL users, including those who use BNPL infrequently or have limited credit histories, while Di Maggio et al.'s transaction-level data may focus on more active BNPL users. This methodological difference highlights the importance of understanding data sources and sample selection when interpreting findings across studies.\n\nThe CFPB report finds that BNPL borrowers exhibit higher credit card utilization rates (60-66% versus 34% for non-BNPL users) and are more likely to revolve on credit cards (69% versus 42%). The high credit card utilization rates (60-66%) documented by the CFPB suggest that BNPL users carry substantial existing debt burdens, limiting their capacity to absorb additional costs. Research on BNPL and financial wellbeing demonstrates that BNPL usage patterns are associated with financial vulnerability and stress, with high utilization rates predicting financial distress.\n\nAgarwal et al. (2009) document that financial decision-making quality varies systematically over the lifecycle, with younger consumers demonstrating higher rates of suboptimal borrowing and debt management behavior. Given that BNPL users skew younger and have limited credit experience, this suggests that the BNPL customer base may be particularly prone to overextension. This demographic concentration amplifies BNPL firms’ credit risk exposure during economic stress periods.\n\nBerg et al. (2020) examine how fintech lenders use digital footprints and alternative data for credit assessment using more than 250,000 observations from an E-commerce company in Germany. They find that digital footprint variables equal or exceed the information content of credit bureau scores: the area under the curve (AUC) using digital footprint variables alone is 69.6%, higher than the AUC using credit bureau score alone (68.3%). When combined, the digital footprint and credit bureau score achieve an AUC of 73.6%, representing a 5.3 percentage point improvement over the credit bureau score alone. The correlation between digital footprint-based scores and credit bureau scores is approximately 10%, indicating that digital footprints complement rather than substitute for traditional credit information. Critically, Berg et al. show that the discriminatory power of digital footprints for unscorable customers (those without credit bureau scores) matches that for scorable customers (72.2% versus 69.6% in-sample, 68.8% versus 68.3% out-of-sample), demonstrating that digital footprints can facilitate credit access for borrowers with limited traditional credit histories. This finding suggests that BNPL firms’ informational advantages, documented by Laudenbach et al. (2025), may be particularly valuable for serving consumers who lack traditional credit records, though the effectiveness of these models during periods of macroeconomic stress remains an open question.\n\nPowell et al. (2023) examine the relationship between responsible financial behaviors and financial wellbeing among BNPL users using a survey of 360 BNPL users in Australia and structural equation modeling. They find that thorough examination of BNPL terms and conditions has the largest coefficient (0.40) and highest significance on financial wellbeing, followed by planning and budgeting (coefficient 0.23, significant at 1% level). Lower compulsive buying also has a significantly positive impact on financial wellbeing (coefficient 0.11), with impulse buying influencing compulsive buying (coefficient 0.36). However, using a debit card instead of a credit card and having multiple BNPL purchases on the go simultaneously were found to have no significant impact on financial wellbeing. Critically, Powell et al. find that younger users (aged under 25) exhibit significantly riskier financial behaviors: they spend less time analyzing BNPL terms and conditions (significant at 1% level), are less likely to plan and budget for purchases (significant at 5% level), and have significantly lower financial wellbeing scores (significant at 1% level). The <25 age group had a higher rate of missed payments (48% versus 39% for the 25+ group) and a larger proportion fell into lower financial wellbeing categories (25% versus 15% for the 25+ group). This finding is consistent with Agarwal et al.‘s (2009) documentation that younger consumers make the worst financial decisions. The concentration of BNPL usage among younger consumers with less financial experience amplifies BNPL firms’ exposure to default risk during economic downturns, creating an additional channel through which economic conditions affect BNPL firm performance.\n\nHayashi and Routh (2024) examine financial constraints among BNPL users. They find that BNPL users tend to be more financially vulnerable than non-users. There is a high correlation between BNPL late payments and financial vulnerability. BNPL users with late payments have overspent or overextended debt. This demonstrates that BNPL access facilitates overconsumption among financially constrained consumers. This finding has implications for understanding BNPL firms’ sensitivity to economic conditions. Financially vulnerable consumers are likely to reduce spending and increase defaults when interest rates rise or economic conditions deteriorate.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Making Ends Meet Report (2022) provides broader context on financial vulnerability and income variability that affects BNPL users, using survey data from over 10,000 households. The report’s findings inform my understanding of how macroeconomic conditions affect BNPL demand.\n\nThe report documents that income variability increased sharply from 2021 to 2022. The share of households experiencing income fluctuations rose from 28% in 2021 to 35% in 2022, creating conditions where consumers turn to BNPL to manage cash flow fluctuations. The report finds that 37% of households could not cover expenses for more than one month if income were lost, indicating widespread financial fragility that makes consumers particularly sensitive to economic shocks. Credit card debt increased substantially for Hispanic consumers and those under 40 between June 2021 and September 2022. Average credit card debt increased by approximately 15-20% for these demographic groups, demonstrating that these demographic groups, which overlap significantly with BNPL users, faced particular financial stress during this period.\n\nFinancial well-being, which had improved during the pandemic, returned to 2019 levels by February 2022. This indicates a deterioration in household financial conditions that coincided with the Federal Reserve’s initial interest rate increases. These patterns demonstrate that BNPL firms serve consumers who face income volatility and financial constraints. BNPL demand is sensitive to changes in household financial conditions that are affected by interest rate changes and broader economic conditions. The documented relationship between income variability and BNPL usage provides motivation for including disposable income measures in my regression analysis. Changes in household financial conditions should affect BNPL demand and, consequently, BNPL stock returns.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond’s research (2024) provides complementary evidence. Financially fragile consumers (credit score below 620, recent credit denials) are almost three times more likely to have repeated BNPL use (five or more times) compared to financially stable consumers. The study finds that 72% of financially stable users and 89% of financially fragile users made multiple BNPL purchases. This indicates high rates of repeat usage. Most concerning, 10% of BNPL users pay BNPL installments with credit cards. This creates debt accumulation patterns that amplify financial vulnerability.","type":"content","url":"/literature#id-2-3-consumer-credit-characteristics-and-financial-vulnerability","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.

I now shift to a macro perspective: understanding the scale and trajectory of BNPL market growth provides essential context for evaluating the sector’s sensitivity to economic conditions. Market size, growth rates, and industry structure affect how interest rate changes propagate through the sector and influence investor expectations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Market Trends Report (2022) analyzes the rapid growth of the BNPL industry. BNPL gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew from 2 billion in 2019 to 24.2 billion in 2021, representing a 1,092% compound annual growth rate. Transaction volume grew from 16.8 million loans in 2019 to 180 million loans in 2021, representing a 970% compound annual growth rate. Average loan size increased from 121 in 2019 to 135 in 2021, indicating both volume and size growth. BNPL accounts for 2-4% of e-commerce transactions, indicating substantial but not dominant market share. The report also shows vertical diversification. Apparel and beauty decreased from 80.1% of GMV in 2019 to 58.6% in 2021, while grocery and everyday purchases grew at a 736% compound annual growth rate. This diversification demonstrates that BNPL is expanding beyond discretionary purchases into everyday spending, which affects sensitivity to economic conditions.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Consumer Use of Buy Now, Pay Later Report (2025) provides updated analysis on market trends and regulatory developments affecting the sector. The report documents continued growth in BNPL adoption and examines the implications of regulatory changes, including the CFPB’s May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit card issuers. This regulatory shift affects BNPL firms’ funding structures, compliance costs, and competitive positioning, altering their sensitivity to interest rate changes. The report also examines consumer use patterns and debt accumulation, providing updated evidence on how BNPL fits into consumers’ broader credit portfolios. The report’s findings on consumer debt accumulation patterns and regulatory changes inform my understanding of how BNPL firms respond to changing market conditions and interest rate environments.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (2024) finds that BNPL grew particularly rapidly during the low-interest rate environment of the pandemic period. This indicates that interest rate conditions affect BNPL growth and profitability. This temporal pattern provides additional evidence that BNPL firms’ performance is sensitive to monetary policy conditions. The sector’s rapid expansion coincided with historically low interest rates.\n\nResearch on BNPL regulation provides insights into how regulatory frameworks affect BNPL firms’ operations and sensitivity to economic conditions. Johnson, Rodwell, and Hendry (2021) examine the regulatory framework governing BNPL services, arguing that fee-based BNPL demonstrates multiple forms of regulatory failure. They identify regulatory capture as a key issue, with minimal consumer protections despite the complexity of BNPL financial products. Their analysis suggests that consumers may lack the financial knowledge required to fully understand BNPL terms and risks, particularly regarding fee structures and debt accumulation. This regulatory gap is significant because it allows BNPL firms to operate with less oversight than traditional credit providers, potentially exposing financially vulnerable consumers to greater risk. The regulatory uncertainty also affects BNPL firms’ business models and funding structures, creating additional sensitivity to regulatory changes such as the CFPB’s May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit card issuers.","type":"content","url":"/literature#id-2-4-market-growth-and-industry-dynamics","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.

Literature Review: BNPL Market Dynamics and Interest Rate Sensitivity","lvl2":"2.5 Interest Rate Sensitivity and Funding Structure"},"content":"The preceding sections have established the demand-side (consumer spending), supply-side (profitability structures), borrower characteristics, and market growth contexts. I now directly examine the core research question: the mechanisms through which interest rate changes affect BNPL firms. This section synthesizes evidence on funding structures, cost pass-through mechanisms, and firm-level responses to monetary policy changes, providing the theoretical foundation for my empirical analysis.\n\nThe theoretical framework for understanding financial institutions’ interest rate sensitivity derives from Flannery and James (1984), who examine how financial institution stock returns respond to interest rate changes. They document that institutions with asset-liability maturity mismatches exhibit significant sensitivity to rate movements, with the magnitude depending on the duration gap structure. This framework applies directly to BNPL firms: their reliance on short-term wholesale funding combined with longer-maturity loan portfolios creates the duration mismatch that amplifies interest rate sensitivity.\n\nBNPL firms exhibit sensitivity to interest rate changes primarily through their funding structure. Laudenbach et al. (2025) show that BNPL firms offer 1.4 percentage point interest rate discounts to consumers, indicating thin profit margins that amplify sensitivity to funding cost changes. BNPL firms must borrow capital from wholesale markets, creating direct exposure to interest rate changes that is not mitigated by deposit funding. This funding structure creates a transmission mechanism whereby monetary policy changes directly affect BNPL firms’ cost of capital, which in turn affects profitability and stock returns.\n\nResearch on financial intermediation and funding costs provides theoretical foundations for understanding this mechanism. Institutions relying on wholesale funding exhibit stronger responses to interest rate changes than deposit-funded institutions. Wholesale funding costs adjust immediately to policy rate changes, while deposit rates adjust more slowly, creating differential sensitivity patterns. This framework helps explain why BNPL firms, which rely almost exclusively on wholesale funding, exhibit immediate pass-through of monetary policy changes to funding costs, unlike traditional banks that benefit from deposit funding stability.\n\nAs detailed in Section 1.1.2, Klarna’s valuation trajectory from its 46 billion peak in June 2021 to its 13-14 billion IPO valuation in September 2025 provides compelling evidence of BNPL firms’ sensitivity to interest rate environments. The 70% valuation decline coincided precisely with the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle, demonstrating how monetary policy affects BNPL firms through multiple channels: direct funding costs, capital market access, and investor expectations.\n\nAffirm Holdings’ Annual Report (2024) identifies “elevated interest rate environment” as a key risk factor, explicitly acknowledging interest rate sensitivity. The report shows that Affirm relies on warehouse credit facilities, securitization, and sale-and-repurchase agreements for funding, all of which typically carry variable interest rates tied to benchmark rates. According to Affirm’s 10-K filings, funding costs increased dramatically during the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle (see Appendix A.1 for detailed analysis). The company uses interest rate swaps and caps to manage interest rate exposure, indicating that management recognizes the risk posed by interest rate changes.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (2024) finds that BNPL grew during the low-interest rate environment of the pandemic, demonstrating that interest rate conditions affect BNPL growth and profitability. The report also notes regulatory changes, specifically the CFPB’s May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit card issuers, which affects BNPL firms’ regulatory environment and funding costs. These firm-level disclosures and regulatory observations provide concrete evidence of the mechanisms through which monetary policy affects BNPL firms, supporting the theoretical framework that motivates our empirical analysis.","type":"content","url":"/literature#id-2-5-interest-rate-sensitivity-and-funding-structure","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.6 Research Contribution and Literature Gaps"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/literature#id-2-6-research-contribution-and-literature-gaps","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.6 Research Contribution and Literature Gaps"},"content":"This study contributes to three distinct strands of literature, each addressing important gaps in understanding of fintech firm behavior and monetary policy transmission. Before detailing these contributions, I explicitly identify the gaps in existing research that motivate this study.\n\nGap 1: No Quantitative Estimates of BNPL Stock Return Sensitivity to Monetary Policy\n\nWhile extensive research documents BNPL’s rapid growth (CFPB 2022) and thin profit margins (Laudenbach et al. 2025), no study quantifies how BNPL equity returns respond to Federal Funds Rate changes. This gap matters because:\n\nStock returns incorporate forward-looking expectations about profitability\n\nReturns reflect multiple transmission channels simultaneously (funding costs, consumer demand, capital access)\n\nInvestors need quantitative estimates to price BNPL-specific interest rate risk\n\nPolicymakers need evidence on whether monetary policy disproportionately affects BNPL firms\n\nExisting studies examine either consumer-side effects (Di Maggio et al. 2022) or firm-level margins (CFPB 2022), but none estimate the elasticity of BNPL stock returns to interest rate changes using multi-factor models that control for market movements and macroeconomic conditions. Bian, Cong, and Ji (2023) examine BNPL’s role in payment competition and credit expansion, documenting that BNPL significantly boosts consumption and complements credit cards for small-value transactions, but do not directly address stock return sensitivity to interest rates. Laudenbach et al. (2025) analyze BNPL firms’ funding costs and profitability, finding that funding costs increase with benchmark rates, but their analysis focuses on European markets and does not examine stock returns.\n\nGap 2: Methodological Limitations in Existing Studies\n\nExisting studies face several methodological constraints that limit their ability to establish causal relationships between interest rates and BNPL performance. Many studies rely on cross-sectional data or short time series that do not capture the full variation in monetary policy conditions. For example, the CFPB Market Trends Report covers 2019-2021, a period characterized primarily by low and stable interest rates, limiting its ability to examine interest-rate sensitivity. Additionally, many studies lack appropriate control variables to isolate interest-rate effects from other macroeconomic factors. My analysis addresses these limitations by using a longer time series (February 2020 to August 2025) that captures substantial variation in monetary policy, and by controlling for market returns, consumer confidence, disposable income, and inflation.\n\nGap 3: Limited Analysis of Transmission Mechanisms\n\nWhile the literature identifies potential mechanisms through which interest rates may affect BNPL firms (funding costs, consumer demand, capital market access), few studies systematically examine these mechanisms empirically or quantify their relative importance. My analysis addresses this gap by estimating a multi-factor regression model that allows me to examine multiple transmission channels simultaneously while isolating the direct effect of interest rate changes.\n\nContributions:\n\nFirst, in the fintech valuation literature, this study analyzes how alternative financial service providers respond to macroeconomic shocks. While extensive research exists on traditional bank sensitivity to interest rates (Flannery and James 1984), relatively little work has analyzed how newer fintech lending models, particularly BNPL firms, respond to monetary policy changes. Research on BNPL regulation and consumer financial behavior provides important context but does not address stock return sensitivity to monetary policy. This study fills this gap by providing empirical evidence on BNPL firms’ sensitivity to monetary policy, contributing to the broader understanding of how fintech firms differ from traditional financial institutions in their response to macroeconomic conditions.\n\nSecond, the study contributes to the monetary policy transmission literature by exploring how unconventional credit providers transmit monetary policy to consumers. Traditional monetary policy transmission mechanisms focus on banks’ lending channels, where policy rate changes affect bank funding costs, which in turn affect lending rates and credit availability. However, BNPL firms represent an alternative credit provision mechanism that amplifies policy effects through different channels. Laudenbach et al. (2025) document that BNPL firms offer 1.4 percentage point interest rate discounts to consumers, indicating thin profit margins that amplify sensitivity to funding cost changes. Hayashi and Routh (2024) examine financial constraints among BNPL users, finding that BNPL borrowers exhibit higher credit card utilization rates and greater financial stress, which amplifies their sensitivity to economic shocks and interest rate changes. This study examines how these thin margins translate into stock return sensitivity, providing insights into monetary policy transmission through alternative credit channels and contributing to the understanding of how monetary policy affects different segments of the credit market.\n\nThird, the study contributes to consumer credit markets research by analyzing the relationship between monetary policy and consumer credit availability through BNPL firms. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Consumer Use Report documents that BNPL borrowers have subprime credit scores (580-669) compared to non-users (670-739), higher credit card utilization rates (60-66% versus 34%), and are more likely to revolve on credit cards (69% versus 42%) (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, “Consumer Use”). Recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond documents the rapid growth of BNPL adoption and its implications for consumer credit markets, noting that BNPL has expanded particularly rapidly among younger consumers and those with limited access to traditional credit (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond). Understanding how monetary policy affects BNPL firms’ ability to extend credit to these consumers has important implications for financial inclusion and consumer welfare, particularly given that BNPL serves consumers who have limited access to traditional credit products.","type":"content","url":"/literature#id-2-6-research-contribution-and-literature-gaps","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.7 Firm-Level Context: PayPal and Affirm"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/literature#id-2-7-firm-level-context-paypal-and-affirm","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.7 Firm-Level Context: PayPal and Affirm"},"content":"Firm-level financial analysis provides microeconomic foundations for understanding BNPL firms’ interest rate sensitivity. Affirm Holdings Inc. (AFRM), a pure-play BNPL provider, demonstrates the sector’s vulnerability through its funding structure and cost dynamics. According to Affirm’s 10-K filings, funding costs increased dramatically during the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle (see Appendix A.1 for detailed analysis). This demonstrates the direct pass-through mechanism: as benchmark rates increase, variable-rate funding facilities reset at higher rates, increasing the cost of capital. Affirm’s high leverage and thin operating margins amplify the impact of funding cost increases on profitability. PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) operates a more diversified business model, with BNPL representing only a portion of its overall operations, potentially providing natural hedging against BNPL-specific funding cost pressures.

These mechanisms inform the empirical analysis presented in Section 4 (Data Analysis) and motivate the inclusion of specific control variables in my regression framework.\n\nInterest Rate Sensitivity Hypothesis: The literature provides strong theoretical motivation for expecting negative relationships between Federal Funds Rate changes and BNPL stock returns. Laudenbach et al. (2025) find that BNPL firms’ funding costs increase by approximately 0.8-1.0 percentage points for each percentage point increase in benchmark interest rates. This indicates near-complete pass-through of monetary policy changes to funding costs. Affirm’s 10-K filings provide firm-level evidence of this mechanism: according to Affirm’s filings, funding costs increased dramatically during the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle (see Appendix A.1 for detailed analysis). Combined with thin profit margins (approximately 1% net transaction margins per CFPB Market Trends Report) and high leverage, these findings indicate that interest rate increases compress profit margins and reduce profitability. This should be reflected in negative stock returns. This theoretical framework motivates my primary hypothesis: BNPL stock returns respond negatively to Federal Funds Rate increases, after controlling for market movements and other macroeconomic factors.\n\nConsumer Confidence Channel: The literature shows strong relationships between consumer sentiment and BNPL demand. Bian, Cong, and Ji (2023) find that a one-standard-deviation increase in consumer confidence is associated with approximately 8-12% increase in BNPL transaction volume. This indicates that consumer sentiment represents an important channel through which macroeconomic conditions affect BNPL firm performance. Di Maggio, Williams, and Katz (2022) find that BNPL access increases spending by approximately $130 per week, with spending remaining elevated for 24 weeks. This indicates that consumer spending patterns directly affect BNPL revenue streams. These findings motivate including consumer confidence measures in my regression analysis. Changes in consumer sentiment should affect BNPL demand and, consequently, stock returns.\n\nDisposable Income Channel: The CFPB Making Ends Meet Report (2022) finds that income variability increased sharply from 2021 to 2022. Thirty-seven percent of households were unable to cover expenses for more than one month if income were lost. The report also finds that credit card debt increased substantially for demographic groups that overlap significantly with BNPL users. This indicates that changes in household financial conditions affect BNPL demand. These patterns indicate that disposable income measures should be included in my regression analysis. Changes in household financial conditions affect BNPL demand and stock returns.\n\nMarket Returns and Inflation: The literature provides less direct evidence on market returns and inflation effects. However, standard asset pricing theory, particularly the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and multi-factor models, suggests that BNPL stock returns should be correlated with market returns through systematic risk factors. The high market beta observed in my regression results (β₅ = 2.38) confirms this theoretical prediction. Inflation may affect BNPL firms through multiple channels: its impact on consumer purchasing power reduces discretionary spending capacity, its effect on funding costs increases the cost of capital, and its influence on economic uncertainty affects consumer confidence and credit demand. I include these variables as controls to isolate the effect of interest rate changes while accounting for broader market movements and macroeconomic conditions, ensuring that my interest rate coefficient captures BNPL-specific sensitivity rather than general market or macroeconomic effects.\n\nEmpirical Strategy: My regression framework, detailed in Section 4, employs a log-linear specification that allows me to estimate elasticities of BNPL stock returns with respect to interest rate changes and other macroeconomic variables. This functional form choice is motivated by both theoretical considerations and empirical evidence. The log transformation addresses heteroskedasticity and distributional skewness common in financial return data, while facilitating elasticity interpretation that is standard in financial econometrics. I employ a two-stage approach that follows established practices in monetary policy transmission research. I begin with a parsimonious base specification that examines the relationship between BNPL returns and interest rate changes, providing a benchmark estimate of interest rate sensitivity. I then estimate a full specification model that incorporates consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation, and market returns as control variables. This sequential estimation strategy serves multiple purposes: it allows me to assess both direct effects of monetary policy on BNPL stock performance and the incremental explanatory power of including additional control variables, it tests the theoretical mechanisms identified in the literature review above, and it enables me to examine the robustness of the interest rate coefficient to the inclusion of control variables, addressing concerns about omitted variable bias.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/literature#id-2-8-bridge-to-empirical-analysis-literature-informed-hypotheses","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.

The study employs a log-linear regression framework to estimate relationships between BNPL stock returns and a set of economic variables, including interest rate changes, consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation, and market returns. We use log-transformed BNPL returns as the dependent variable to facilitate elasticity interpretation and address common issues in financial return data (see Appendix for detailed justification).\n\nThe modeling strategy employs a two-stage approach, beginning with a parsimonious base specification that examines the relationship between BNPL returns and interest rate changes, followed by a full specification model that incorporates multiple economic channels simultaneously. This sequential estimation strategy enables us to assess both direct effects of monetary policy on BNPL stock performance and the incremental explanatory power of including additional control variables. All models are estimated using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression with robust standard errors (HC3) to address heteroskedasticity, which is a common feature of financial return data.\n\nThe motivation for this work stems from the rapid growth and increasing economic significance of the BNPL sector. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s 2025 report, BNPL adoption has experienced substantial growth, with 21% of consumers with credit records utilizing BNPL services in 2022, representing an increase from 18% in 2021. This expansion, combined with the sector’s sensitivity to funding costs and capital market conditions, makes understanding the determinants of BNPL stock returns relevant for both investors seeking to assess risk exposure and policymakers concerned with financial stability and consumer protection. The sector’s reliance on short-term funding markets and its sensitivity to consumer spending patterns indicate that BNPL stock returns respond systematically to changes in monetary policy, macroeconomic conditions, and broader market movements. The extent and nature of these relationships are the focus of this analysis.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/dataanalysis#id-3-data-analysis-interest-rate-sensitivity-and-economic-determinants","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.1 Data Construction and Variable Selection"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/dataanalysis#id-3-1-data-construction-and-variable-selection","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.1 Data Construction and Variable Selection"},"content":"This section describes the data construction process and the rationale for variable selection in our econometric models.

(PYPL), Affirm Holdings Inc. (AFRM), and Sezzle Inc. (SEZL). These firms were selected based on criteria established in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Market Trends Report, which identifies major BNPL providers in the U.S. market.\n\nSeveral important limitations affect this firm selection. First, the sample excludes other major BNPL providers that are not publicly traded (e.g., Klarna, Afterpay prior to acquisition, Zip) or that went public after our sample period ends (e.g., Klarna IPO in September 2025). Second, the sample excludes firms with insufficient trading history or data availability issues (e.g., Block/Square’s BNPL operations are not separately traded). Third, the sample may suffer from survivorship bias, as only firms that survived and went public are included.\n\nThese limitations mean our results may not generalize to the broader BNPL sector, particularly smaller providers or those operating under different business models. However, the three firms included represent substantial market coverage: PayPal’s BNPL product (Pay in 4) represents 68.1% of U.S. BNPL market share, making it the largest BNPL provider. Affirm and Sezzle are pure-play BNPL providers that went public in 2020-2021, providing representative coverage of the sector’s business models.\n\nPortfolio Weighting: Equal vs. Value Weighting\n\nWe construct the BNPL portfolio using equal weighting, where each firm receives equal weight regardless of market capitalization. This approach has both advantages and limitations.\n\nEqual weighting reduces the dominance of PayPal, which has substantially larger market capitalization than Affirm or Sezzle. This ensures that pure-play BNPL firms (Affirm, Sezzle) receive equal representation in the portfolio, capturing sector-wide patterns rather than being dominated by PayPal’s diversified operations. Equal weighting also reduces the influence of market capitalization changes that may be unrelated to BNPL-specific factors.\n\nHowever, equal weighting creates a distorted representation of the sector’s economic importance. PayPal’s BNPL operations represent the majority of market share, yet receive only one-third weight in the portfolio. This may bias results if PayPal exhibits different sensitivity patterns than pure-play BNPL firms. Additionally, Sezzle’s small market capitalization and limited liquidity may introduce noise into the portfolio return.\n\nAs a robustness check, we examine specifications excluding PayPal (Section 4.6.5) and excluding Sezzle to assess sensitivity to portfolio construction choices. Alternative portfolio constructions—value-weighted portfolios, principal component analysis, or firm-level panel regressions—are discussed in robustness checks but not implemented due to sample size constraints.\n\nReturn Calculation and Log Transformation\n\nFor each individual BNPL company, we calculate monthly returns as:R_{i,t} = \\frac{P_{i,t} - P_{i,t-1}}{P_{i,t-1}} \\times 100\n\nwhere P_{i,t} is the month-end closing price for firm i in month t. The portfolio return is then calculated as the equally-weighted average:R_{t}^{BNPL} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} R_{i,t}\n\nwhere N = 3 (PYPL, AFRM, SEZL).\n\nThe dependent variable uses a log transformation: \\log(1 + R_{t}^{BNPL}/100) \\times 100. This transformation addresses distributional skewness, stabilizes variance, and facilitates elasticity interpretation of coefficients.

The portfolio return is calculated as an equally-weighted average of the three firms’ returns. The log transformation \\log(1 + R_{t}^{BNPL}/100) \\times 100 is applied to address right-skewness in return distributions and to facilitate elasticity interpretation. This transformation ensures that returns are defined for all values including negative returns (which cannot be log-transformed directly). The mean return of 0.85% per month (approximately 10.2% annualized) reflects the sample period’s mixed performance, while the standard deviation of 12.34% indicates substantial volatility. This high volatility (12.34% monthly standard deviation) means that even economically meaningful relationships may fail to achieve statistical significance, which helps explain why our interest rate coefficient is economically large but statistically insignificant.\n\nFederal Funds Rate Changes: We calculate month-over-month changes by taking first differences of the effective Federal Funds Rate from FRED. The mean change of 0.02 percentage points reflects the gradual nature of monetary policy adjustments, while the standard deviation of 0.18 percentage points captures periods of rapid policy shifts (notably 2022-2023). The range from -0.50 to +0.75 percentage points reflects the Federal Reserve’s most aggressive tightening cycle since the 1980s. The preponderance of zero observations (rate unchanged for multiple months) creates measurement challenges but aligns with how monetary policy actually operates. This low-frequency variation (many zero observations) reduces statistical power to detect relationships, which may explain why our interest rate coefficient fails to achieve statistical significance despite its economic magnitude.\n\nConsumer Confidence Changes: Month-over-month changes in the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index capture shifts in forward-looking consumer expectations. The mean change of -0.15 points reflects overall sentiment decline during the sample period (driven by pandemic uncertainty and inflation concerns), while the large standard deviation (4.82 points) captures substantial month-to-month volatility in consumer sentiment. The index ranges from 50 to 150, with changes reflecting shifts in consumer spending intentions that directly affect BNPL transaction volume. This volatility in consumer sentiment creates substantial variation that should help identify relationships, yet our consumer confidence coefficient approaches but does not achieve statistical significance, suggesting that market returns may capture much of the systematic variation in consumer sentiment.\n\nDisposable Income Changes: We calculate month-over-month percentage changes in real (inflation-adjusted) disposable personal income from FRED. The mean growth rate of 0.18% per month (approximately 2.2% annualized) reflects moderate income growth during the sample period, while the standard deviation of 0.78% captures substantial variation including pandemic-related income shocks. Negative values (minimum -2.10%) reflect periods of income decline, while positive values capture income recovery and growth phases.\n\nInflation Changes: Month-over-month percentage changes in the seasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index capture inflation shocks affecting consumer purchasing power. The mean change of 0.42% per month (approximately 5.0% annualized) reflects elevated inflation during much of the sample period, while the standard deviation of 0.58% captures substantial variation from near-zero inflation (2020) to peak inflation (mid-2022). The range from -0.80% to +1.60% reflects deflationary and hyperinflationary episodes within the sample.\n\nMarket Returns: Monthly returns on the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) proxy for systematic market risk. The mean return of 0.89% per month (approximately 10.7% annualized) reflects overall market performance during the sample period, while the standard deviation of 4.52% indicates substantial market volatility. The range from -12.35% to +9.25% captures major market movements including pandemic-related crashes and recovery rallies. The fact that market returns explain 51% of BNPL return variation (R² = 0.51) indicates that systematic market factors dominate BNPL stock performance, potentially obscuring the relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns.\n\nInterest Rate Variable: Federal Funds Rate Changes\n\nWe use month-over-month changes in the Federal Funds Rate (\\Delta FFR_t) rather than levels. This choice addresses several concerns. First, interest rate levels may be non-stationary, while changes are typically stationary (though ADF tests show mixed results, see Section 4.3.4). Second, changes capture policy shifts more directly than levels, which may reflect long-term trends unrelated to current policy. Third, changes align with the theoretical mechanism: BNPL firms respond to funding cost changes, not absolute rate levels.\n\nHowever, using monthly changes creates measurement challenges. The Federal Funds Rate changes infrequently (often remaining constant for multiple months), creating many zero observations. This low-frequency variation may create attenuation bias and reduce statistical power. Alternative specifications using 2-year Treasury yield changes (Section 4.6.1) address this concern by providing higher-frequency variation.\n\nLag Structure and Timing Considerations\n\nMacroeconomic variables are measured contemporaneously with BNPL returns, creating potential simultaneity concerns. Macro data is typically released during the month (e.g., CPI released mid-month), while stock returns reflect information available throughout the month. This timing mismatch may bias estimates if macro data releases affect stock prices within the same month.\n\nIdeally, we would use lagged macro variables (e.g., \\Delta CC_{t-1}, \\Delta DI_{t-1}) to ensure that macro conditions are known before stock returns are realized. However, using contemporaneous variables captures the forward-looking nature of stock prices, which incorporate expectations about future macro conditions. As a robustness check, we examine specifications with lagged macro variables (discussed in Section 4.6), though results are not substantially different.\n\nMarket Returns\n\nWe use the S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (SPY) as a proxy for broad market returns. The S&P 500 represents approximately 80% of U.S. equity market capitalization and provides a comprehensive benchmark for systematic market risk. Monthly returns are calculated as percentage changes in month-end closing prices, ensuring temporal alignment with BNPL stock returns.\n\nConsumer Confidence\n\nWe employ the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (UMCSENT) as a measure of forward-looking consumer spending intentions. This index captures consumers’ expectations about future economic conditions and their own financial situation, which should directly affect BNPL usage as consumers make purchasing decisions. We calculate month-over-month changes to capture shifts in consumer sentiment that may affect BNPL transaction volume.\n\nDisposable Income\n\nWe use real disposable personal income (DSPIC96) from FRED, which measures inflation-adjusted personal income after taxes. This variable captures the income channel through which economic conditions affect consumer purchasing power and BNPL usage. We calculate percentage changes (month-over-month) to measure growth in disposable income, which is more economically meaningful than levels for analyzing the relationship with stock returns.\n\nInflation\n\nWe employ the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Seasonally Adjusted (CPIAUCSLSA) as a measure of inflation. We use the seasonally adjusted series to remove predictable seasonal patterns (such as holiday shopping effects) that could confound our analysis. Seasonal adjustment is important for CPI because consumer prices can exhibit regular seasonal fluctuations that are unrelated to underlying inflation trends. We calculate month-over-month percentage changes to capture inflation shocks that may affect consumer purchasing power and spending patterns.\n\nSeasonal Adjustment\n\nWe use seasonally adjusted data where available to remove predictable seasonal patterns that could confound our analysis. Real disposable personal income (DSPIC96) is obtained from FRED in seasonally adjusted form by default. Consumer Price Index (CPIAUCSLSA) is obtained as the seasonally adjusted series to remove seasonal patterns in consumer prices. Consumer sentiment (UMCSENT) and Federal Funds Rate (FEDFUNDS) do not require seasonal adjustment, as consumer sentiment is a survey-based index and interest rates do not exhibit predictable seasonal patterns. Stock returns are already in first-difference form (monthly changes) and do not require seasonal adjustment.\n\nData Alignment and Temporal Coverage\n\nSample Period and Observations: The sample period spans from February 2020 to August 2025, providing 67 monthly observations. This period encompasses several important macroeconomic events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, monetary policy tightening in 2022-2023, and subsequent policy normalization, providing substantial variation in both dependent and independent variables necessary for econometric inference.\n\nTemporal Alignment: All variables are aligned to monthly frequency and synchronized to month-end dates to ensure temporal consistency. Stock prices are measured at month-end closing prices, and macroeconomic variables are aligned to the same month-end dates. This synchronization ensures that all variables reflect conditions during the same time period.\n\nMissing Data Handling: We handle missing data using inner joins when merging variables from different sources. This approach retains only observations where all variables have complete data, ensuring a balanced panel dataset. After merging, we apply an additional dropna() operation to remove any remaining missing values. This conservative approach ensures that our final sample consists of 67 complete observations with no missing data across any variable. No observations were excluded due to missing data, indicating complete data availability across all variables for the sample period.\n\nData Quality: All variables exhibit complete coverage for the sample period. Stock return data from Yahoo Finance provides continuous coverage for all three BNPL firms throughout the period. Macroeconomic data from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) provides complete monthly series for all variables. The final dataset contains no missing values, ensuring that all 67 observations are used in regression estimation.","type":"content","url":"/dataanalysis#id-3-1-2-variable-definitions-and-data-sources","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.1 Data Construction and Variable Selection","lvl2":"3.1.3 Interest Rate Variable Selection: Theoretical and Empirical Considerations"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/dataanalysis#id-3-1-3-interest-rate-variable-selection-theoretical-and-empirical-considerations","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.1 Data Construction and Variable Selection","lvl2":"3.1.3 Interest Rate Variable Selection: Theoretical and Empirical Considerations"},"content":"The selection of an appropriate interest rate variable requires balancing theoretical relevance with empirical considerations. While multiple interest rate measures could potentially capture BNPL firms’ funding costs, we focus on the Federal Funds Rate for several reasons. First, BNPL firms rely heavily on short-term funding markets, including warehouse credit facilities, securitization markets, and commercial paper markets, all of which are directly influenced by the Federal Funds Rate. Second, the Federal Funds Rate serves as the primary monetary policy instrument, making it the most policy-relevant measure for understanding how monetary policy affects BNPL stock returns. Third, data availability and reliability favor the Federal Funds Rate, which is published daily by the Federal Reserve and has a long historical record.\n\nAlternative interest rate measures, such as commercial paper rates or credit spreads, could theoretically provide more direct measures of BNPL firms’ actual funding costs. However, these alternatives face data availability constraints and are highly correlated with the Federal Funds Rate, making the incremental benefit of using alternative measures limited. The Federal Funds Rate provides a clean, policy-relevant measure that captures the primary channel through which monetary policy affects BNPL firms’ cost of capital.","type":"content","url":"/dataanalysis#id-3-1-3-interest-rate-variable-selection-theoretical-and-empirical-considerations","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.1 Data Construction and Variable Selection","lvl2":"3.1.4 Model Specification: Theoretical Framework"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/dataanalysis#id-3-1-4-model-specification-theoretical-framework","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.1 Data Construction and Variable Selection","lvl2":"3.1.4 Model Specification: Theoretical Framework"},"content":"The econometric models we estimate are motivated by theoretical considerations regarding the determinants of equity returns in general and BNPL stock returns in particular. The base model focuses on interest rate sensitivity, motivated by the sector’s reliance on short-term funding markets documented by the CFPB (2025). The full specification model extends this framework by incorporating additional economic channels that theory suggests should affect BNPL stock performance: consumer spending patterns (captured by consumer confidence and disposable income), purchasing power effects (captured by inflation), and systematic market risk (captured by market returns).\n\nBase Model Specification:\\log(1 + BNPL\\_Return_t/100) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(\\Delta Federal\\_Funds\\_Rate_t) + \\varepsilon_t\n\nwhere BNPL_Return_t is the monthly return in percentage terms. The transformation log(1 + BNPL_Return_t/100) addresses distributional skewness, truncation at -100%, and approximates continuously compounded returns. This specification tests the hypothesis that BNPL stock returns are associated with changes in short-term interest rates, which would be expected given BNPL firms’ reliance on funding markets. The coefficient \\beta_1 measures the elasticity of BNPL returns with respect to Federal Funds Rate changes, with a negative coefficient expected if higher interest rates increase funding costs and reduce profitability.\n\nFull Specification Model:\\log(1 + BNPL\\_Return_t/100) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(\\Delta Federal\\_Funds\\_Rate_t) + \\beta_2(\\Delta Consumer\\_Confidence_t) + \\beta_3(\\Delta Disposable\\_Income_t) + \\beta_4(\\Delta Inflation_t) + \\beta_5(Market\\_Return_t) + \\varepsilon_t\n\nThis specification extends the base model by incorporating control variables that capture additional economic channels affecting BNPL stock returns. The inclusion of these variables serves multiple purposes: (1) controlling for factors that may be correlated with interest rates, providing a more accurate estimate of the direct interest rate effect; (2) capturing additional economic mechanisms that theory suggests should affect BNPL performance; and (3) improving model fit and reducing omitted variable bias.\n\nThe theoretical justification for each control variable stems from understanding how BNPL firms generate revenue and face costs. Consumer confidence affects forward-looking spending intentions, directly influencing BNPL transaction volume. Disposable income affects consumers’ ability to make purchases and use BNPL services. Inflation affects purchasing power and may influence consumer spending patterns. Market returns capture systematic market risk, isolating BNPL-specific effects from general market movements. Together, these variables provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the multiple economic channels affecting BNPL stock performance.\n\n\n\n# ============================================================================\n# FIRM-LEVEL FINANCIAL HEALTH ANALYSIS: PayPal and Affirm\n# ============================================================================\n# Analysis Period: 2020-2025\n# Focus: Financial health trends, profitability, cash flow, operational metrics\n# ============================================================================\n\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# print(\"Firms: PayPal Holdings Inc.

The log transformation, calculated as log(1 + return/100), is applied for several methodological reasons that we discuss in detail below, but the visual representation helps us understand the temporal patterns in BNPL stock performance before we begin formal econometric analysis.\n\nWhy Log Transformation? Before discussing the patterns visible in the chart, it is worth explaining why we transform returns using the natural logarithm. Financial return data commonly exhibit heteroskedasticity, where the variance of returns changes over time—typically higher during volatile periods and lower during calm periods. Log transformations help stabilize this variance structure, making the data more suitable for regression analysis. Additionally, equity returns often exhibit right-skewed distributions due to the presence of extreme positive returns, and log transformations help normalize these distributions, improving the validity of statistical inference. Finally, the log-linear specification facilitates elasticity interpretation: regression coefficients can be interpreted as percentage changes in returns per unit change in independent variables, providing intuitive economic meaning.\n\nTemporal Patterns: The time series reveals substantial volatility in BNPL stock returns throughout the sample period, with notable episodes of both positive and negative performance. This volatility is not random but corresponds to distinct macroeconomic and sector-specific events that inform our understanding of BNPL stock performance. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 coincided with significant negative returns, reflecting initial market uncertainty regarding BNPL firms’ ability to weather economic disruption. Investors were concerned about potential deterioration in consumer credit quality, reduced consumer spending, and the sector’s ability to maintain transaction volume during an economic downturn.\n\nThe period of strong positive returns in late 2020 and 2021 reflects the rapid growth in BNPL adoption documented by the CFPB (2025), as consumers turned to alternative payment methods during the pandemic. This period saw increased transaction volume and revenue growth for BNPL providers, as consumers shifted purchasing behavior toward e-commerce and sought flexible payment options during a period of economic uncertainty. The sharp negative returns observed in mid-2022 align with rising interest rates and increased funding costs, consistent with the CFPB’s documentation that BNPL firms’ cost of funds increased substantially during this period. Higher interest rates compressed profit margins and reduced investor confidence, as the sector’s thin margins (provider revenues represent only about 4% of gross merchandise volume according to Digital Silk, 2025) made firms particularly vulnerable to funding cost increases.\n\nThe period from late 2023 through 2025 exhibits continued volatility, reflecting ongoing sensitivity to monetary policy changes, macroeconomic conditions, and sector-specific developments. This persistent volatility provides empirical motivation for our econometric analysis, which seeks to identify systematic factors that explain this observed variation.\nVisual Design Elements: The chart uses blue shading to indicate periods of positive returns (above the zero line) and orange shading to indicate negative returns (below zero). This visual distinction facilitates identification of periods when BNPL stocks outperformed relative to their long-run average versus periods of underperformance. The dashed horizontal line at zero provides a reference point for assessing whether returns are positive or negative in any given month.","type":"content","url":"/dataanalysis#id-3-2-1-chart-a-time-series-of-log-bnpl-returns","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.2 Visual Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis and Preliminary Patterns","lvl2":"3.2.2 Chart B: Scatter Plot of Log BNPL Returns vs Interest Rate Changes"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/dataanalysis#id-3-2-2-chart-b-scatter-plot-of-log-bnpl-returns-vs-interest-rate-changes","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.2 Visual Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis and Preliminary Patterns","lvl2":"3.2.2 Chart B: Scatter Plot of Log BNPL Returns vs Interest Rate Changes"},"content":"\n\nChart B presents a scatter plot of log BNPL returns against month-over-month changes in the Federal Funds Rate, accompanied by the estimated regression line and 95% confidence interval. This visualization provides a direct visual test of our primary hypothesis that BNPL stock returns exhibit sensitivity to monetary policy changes. The scatter plot displays monthly observations (blue circles) with the fitted regression line (orange) and confidence interval (light orange shading), enabling visual assessment of the relationship between interest rate changes and BNPL stock returns.\n\nVisual Interpretation: The scatter plot reveals substantial dispersion around the regression line, with many observations deviating significantly from the fitted line. This dispersion is not merely noise but reflects the presence of other factors beyond interest rates that substantially affect BNPL stock performance. The negative slope of the regression line (estimated coefficient of -12.51) is visible in the chart, showing a negative point estimate, though this relationship is not statistically significant in BNPL returns, consistent with theoretical expectations. However, the wide confidence interval (indicated by the light orange shading) reflects substantial uncertainty around this estimate, consistent with the high volatility observed in the time series plot.\n\nStatistical Interpretation: The regression results indicate a negative relationship between interest rate changes and log BNPL returns, the point estimate aligns with theoretical predictions, but statistical insignificance prevents us from concluding a relationship exists on BNPL firm performance. The estimated slope coefficient is -12.51, The point estimate indicates that a one percentage point increase in the Federal Funds Rate change would be associated with approximately a 12.51% decrease in log BNPL returns, but this relationship is not statistically significant and we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no effect. However, this relationship is not statistically significant at conventional levels (p-value = 0.2202), and the R² of 0.022 indicates that interest rate changes alone explain only 2.2% of the variation in log BNPL returns. The 95% confidence interval for the slope coefficient is [-32.69, 7.67], which includes zero and reflects substantial uncertainty around the point estimate, consistent with the high volatility observed in the time series plot and the presence of other unobserved factors affecting BNPL returns.\n\nImplications for Model Specification: The substantial dispersion around the regression line provides empirical motivation for our full specification model, which incorporates additional control variables to capture these other economic channels and improve the model’s explanatory power. The fact that interest rates alone explain only 2.2% of return variation suggests that other factors play important roles in determining BNPL stock performance, motivating the inclusion of consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation, and market returns in the full model.\n\nVisual Design Elements: The x-axis tick marks are set at 0.1 percentage point intervals to provide clear visual reference points for interpreting the magnitude of interest rate changes and facilitate comparison across observations. The blue color scheme for observations and orange for the regression line maintains visual consistency with Chart A, while the confidence interval shading provides visual representation of statistical uncertainty around the point estimate.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/dataanalysis#id-3-2-2-chart-b-scatter-plot-of-log-bnpl-returns-vs-interest-rate-changes","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.3 Functional Form Selection: Justification for Log-Linear Specification"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/dataanalysis#id-3-3-functional-form-selection-justification-for-log-linear-specification","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.3 Functional Form Selection: Justification for Log-Linear Specification"},"content":"We use log-transformed BNPL returns as the dependent variable to address heteroskedasticity, normalize distributions, and facilitate elasticity interpretation of coefficients.

The full model adds four control variables: consumer confidence changes, disposable income changes, inflation changes, and market returns. Both models include a constant term.

This structure allows us to isolate the partial effect of interest rate changes while controlling for other factors that simultaneously affect BNPL returns. This decomposition is crucial because it separates BNPL-specific sensitivity from general market movements, enabling us to test whether BNPL stocks respond to interest rates beyond their correlation with the broader market.\n\nIdentification Challenges: Several identification challenges affect our ability to estimate causal effects.\n\nEndogeneity from Simultaneous Determination: Federal Funds Rate changes are not exogenous shocks—they respond to economic conditions (inflation, unemployment, GDP growth) that also affect BNPL returns. When the Fed raises rates in response to inflation, both the rate increase and the underlying inflation affect BNPL returns simultaneously. This creates endogeneity bias: our coefficient captures both the direct effect of interest rates and the indirect effect of the economic conditions that prompted the rate change. This means our estimate may be biased upward (less negative) if inflation negatively affects BNPL returns independently of interest rates, or biased downward (more negative) if economic growth positively affects BNPL returns.\n\nOmitted Variable Bias: Several unobserved factors may correlate with both interest rates and BNPL returns, biasing our estimates:\n\nRegulatory changes: The CFPB’s May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit cards occurred during a period of rising interest rates. If this regulatory change affected BNPL stock prices independently of interest rates, our coefficient would be biased. Similarly, state-level regulatory changes or enforcement actions may coincide with monetary policy cycles.\n\nCompetitive dynamics: Entry of new BNPL providers, merchant partnerships, or competitive pricing changes may correlate with economic conditions that also affect interest rates. For example, during economic expansions (when rates may rise), BNPL firms may face increased competition, affecting stock returns independently of funding costs.\n\nFirm-specific news: Earnings announcements, product launches, management changes, or credit quality disclosures may correlate with macroeconomic conditions that prompt interest rate changes. If these firm-specific factors affect BNPL returns independently of interest rates, our coefficient would be biased.\n\nSector-specific shocks: Fintech sector sentiment, technology stock performance, or broader fintech regulatory developments may correlate with monetary policy cycles, creating omitted variable bias.\n\nReverse Causality: While unlikely, several reverse causality channels could bias our estimates:\n\nFinancial stability channel: If BNPL stock performance signals broader financial stability concerns (e.g., widespread credit defaults), the Fed may respond by adjusting monetary policy. However, BNPL firms represent a small portion of the economy, making this channel unlikely to materially affect Federal Funds Rate decisions.\n\nCredit market channel: If BNPL stock performance reflects broader credit market conditions that the Fed monitors, monetary policy may respond to these conditions. However, the Fed primarily responds to aggregate economic indicators rather than individual stock performance.\n\nIndirect feedback: BNPL stock performance may affect consumer confidence or spending patterns, which the Fed monitors. However, this indirect channel is likely weak given BNPL’s small market share relative to overall consumer spending.\n\nThese challenges mean we cannot interpret our coefficient as a causal effect, but rather as a conditional association that provides evidence on whether BNPL stocks exhibit sensitivity patterns consistent with theoretical predictions.\n\nIdentification Strategy: We address these challenges through several approaches. First, we control for market returns, which capture systematic risk factors that may be correlated with interest rates. Second, we include macroeconomic controls (consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation) that may confound the interest rate relationship. Third, we use robust standard errors to address heteroskedasticity that could bias inference. However, these approaches do not fully resolve endogeneity concerns—our estimates should be interpreted as associations rather than causal effects. This limitation is important because it means we cannot definitively conclude that interest rate changes cause BNPL return changes, only that they are associated conditional on our controls.\n\nWhat We Can Identify: Our regression framework identifies the partial correlation between interest rate changes and BNPL returns, conditional on the included control variables. This partial correlation captures how BNPL returns move with interest rates after accounting for market movements and macroeconomic conditions. While this does not establish causality, it provides descriptive evidence on whether BNPL stocks exhibit sensitivity patterns consistent with theoretical predictions. This evidence is valuable for investors assessing risk exposure and policymakers understanding monetary policy transmission, even if it does not establish causality.","type":"content","url":"/dataanalysis#id-3-4-2-regression-structure-and-identification","position":27},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.4 Model Estimation and Identification Strategy","lvl2":"3.4.3 Identification Assumptions"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/dataanalysis#id-3-4-3-identification-assumptions","position":28},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.4 Model Estimation and Identification Strategy","lvl2":"3.4.3 Identification Assumptions"},"content":"To interpret our coefficient estimates as meaningful associations, we rely on several identification assumptions:\n\nAssumption 1: Conditional Exogeneity: Conditional on the included control variables (market returns, consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation), Federal Funds Rate changes are uncorrelated with the error term. This assumption requires that all factors that simultaneously affect both interest rates and BNPL returns are included in the model. If this assumption is violated—for example, if regulatory changes or competitive dynamics correlate with both interest rates and BNPL returns—our coefficient estimates may be biased.\n\nAssumption 2: Linearity: The relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns is linear. This assumption allows us to interpret the coefficient as a constant elasticity. If the relationship is nonlinear (e.g., sensitivity increases at higher rate levels), our linear specification may miss important patterns.\n\nAssumption 3: No Simultaneity: BNPL stock returns do not affect Federal Funds Rate changes within the same month. This assumption is likely satisfied given that BNPL firms represent a small portion of the economy, making it unlikely that their stock performance influences monetary policy decisions. However, if the Fed responds to broader fintech or credit market conditions that correlate with BNPL returns, this assumption may be violated.\n\nAssumption 4: Stable Parameters: The relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns is constant over the sample period. This assumption allows us to pool observations across time. If sensitivity patterns changed as the BNPL sector matured or as regulatory frameworks evolved, our estimates would represent an average effect that may not reflect current conditions.\n\nWhat These Assumptions Mean: These assumptions are standard in observational studies but are not testable directly. We assess their plausibility through robustness checks (alternative specifications, sample periods, interest rate measures) and diagnostic tests (residual analysis, stability tests). The fact that our coefficient remains stable across specifications provides some evidence that these assumptions may be approximately satisfied, though we cannot definitively verify them.","type":"content","url":"/dataanalysis#id-3-4-3-identification-assumptions","position":29},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.4 Model Estimation and Identification Strategy","lvl2":"3.4.4 Model Limitations"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/dataanalysis#id-3-4-4-model-limitations","position":30},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.4 Model Estimation and Identification Strategy","lvl2":"3.4.4 Model Limitations"},"content":"This analysis faces several constraints that affect interpretation.

Third, the portfolio approach masks firm-level heterogeneity—individual BNPL firms may exhibit different sensitivity patterns that are obscured by aggregation. Fourth, we cannot establish causality from observational data alone—results should be interpreted as associations rather than causal effects.

We estimate the DiD model using the full specification that matches our main regression analysis, incorporating control variables to address confounding factors:\\log(Return_{it}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(BNPL_i) + \\beta_2(\\Delta FFR_t) + \\beta_3(BNPL_i \\times \\Delta FFR_t) + \\beta_4(R_{Market,t}) + \\beta_5(\\Delta CC_t) + \\beta_6(\\Delta DI_t) + \\beta_7(\\Delta \\pi_t) + \\varepsilon_{it}\n\nwhere BNPL_i is a dummy variable equal to 1 for BNPL firms and 0 for fintech lenders, R_{Market,t} represents market returns, \\Delta CC_t denotes changes in consumer confidence, \\Delta DI_t represents changes in disposable income, and \\Delta \\pi_t denotes changes in inflation. The coefficient \\beta_3 captures the differential sensitivity of BNPL firms to interest rate changes, relative to fintech lenders, after controlling for market movements and other macroeconomic factors. This approach addresses omitted variable bias by using fintech lenders as a control group that experiences similar macroeconomic shocks but has different structural characteristics, while also controlling for confounding factors that may affect both BNPL and fintech lender returns simultaneously.\n\nTo assess the robustness of our DiD estimates, we compare the full model estimated on the complete sample with the same full model estimated excluding the COVID-19 period (February-June 2020). This robustness check tests whether our results are sensitive to the inclusion of this unusual period characterized by extreme market volatility. If the coefficient estimates remain stable across these different samples, this provides evidence that our findings are robust and not driven by the specific conditions of the pandemic period.","type":"content","url":"/dataanalysis#strategy-1-difference-in-differences-did","position":51},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.7 Alternative Analytical Approaches: Robustness Checks","lvl2":"Strategy 2: Panel Data with Firm Fixed Effects"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/dataanalysis#strategy-2-panel-data-with-firm-fixed-effects","position":52},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.7 Alternative Analytical Approaches: Robustness Checks","lvl2":"Strategy 2: Panel Data with Firm Fixed Effects"},"content":"**The panel data approach uses individual firm returns (PYPL, AFRM, SEZL) instead of portfolio averages, allowing us to control for unobserved firm-specific factors through firm fixed effects.

This magnitude is economically substantial—if the Fed raises rates by 0.5 percentage points (a typical policy move), BNPL stocks would decline by roughly 6.4% on average. The standard error of 9.95 reflects the high volatility of BNPL returns, making it difficult to achieve statistical significance even with economically meaningful effects. The 95% confidence interval [-32.18, 6.81] includes zero and spans nearly 40 percentage points, reflecting substantial uncertainty.\n\nMarket Return Coefficient (β₅ = 2.38, p-value < 0.001): This coefficient is highly statistically significant and economically large. A 1% increase in market returns is associated with a 2.38% increase in BNPL returns, indicating a market beta of 2.38. This beta is more than double the average stock (β ≈ 1.0), placing BNPL stocks among the highest-beta securities in the market. The t-statistic of 7.25 and p-value < 0.001 indicate extremely strong statistical evidence. The 95% confidence interval [1.74, 3.03] excludes zero and is relatively narrow, reflecting precise estimation.\n\nInflation Coefficient (β₄ = -12.94, p-value = 0.049): This coefficient is statistically significant at the 5% level and economically large. A one percentage point increase in monthly inflation is associated with a 12.9% decrease in BNPL returns. This relationship likely operates through multiple channels: inflation erodes consumer purchasing power, reducing discretionary spending and BNPL transaction volume; inflation increases funding costs through its effect on nominal interest rates; and inflation creates economic uncertainty affecting consumer confidence. The 95% confidence interval [-25.81, -0.06] barely excludes zero, indicating marginal significance.\n\nConsumer Confidence Coefficient (β₂ = 0.75, p-value = 0.102): This coefficient approaches statistical significance (p-value = 0.102) and has the expected positive sign. A one-point increase in consumer confidence is associated with a 0.75% increase in BNPL returns. The lack of statistical significance may reflect the dominance of market returns in capturing systematic variation, or it may indicate that consumer confidence affects BNPL returns through indirect channels (such as market sentiment) rather than directly.\n\nDisposable Income Coefficient (β₃ = -0.59, p-value = 0.493): This coefficient is not statistically significant and has an unexpected negative sign. Theoretically, higher disposable income should increase BNPL usage and returns. The negative sign may reflect that income growth is correlated with other factors (such as inflation or interest rates) that negatively affect BNPL returns, or it may indicate that BNPL serves as a substitute for cash purchases rather than a complement to income. The large standard error (0.86) relative to the coefficient magnitude (-0.59) indicates imprecise estimation.\n\nConstant Term (β₀ = 4.99, p-value = 0.041): The intercept is statistically significant, indicating that BNPL returns have a positive expected value conditional on all regressors being zero.

Empirical Results","lvl2":"4.3 Interpreting the Null Result"},"content":"The coefficient estimate is -12.68, indicating that a one percentage point increase in the Federal Funds Rate is associated with approximately a 12.7% decrease in log BNPL returns. This point estimate is economically substantial—a 0.5 percentage point rate increase would correspond to roughly a 6.4% decline in BNPL returns on average. However, the p-value of 0.202 indicates that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that this relationship is zero. The 95% confidence interval ranges from -32.2 to 6.8, which includes zero and reflects substantial statistical uncertainty around the point estimate.\n\nWhy might the effect be economically large but statistically insignificant?\n\nSeveral factors may explain this pattern. First, BNPL stocks exhibit high volatility, with monthly returns frequently exceeding 20% in absolute magnitude. This high volatility creates substantial noise that makes it difficult to detect systematic relationships, even when such relationships exist. When return variance is dominated by idiosyncratic factors, even economically meaningful effects may fail to achieve statistical significance. The standard error of 9.95 reflects this high volatility—even a coefficient of -12.68 is not large enough relative to the noise to achieve statistical significance.\n\nSecond, investors may price BNPL stocks more similarly to technology stocks than to traditional financial stocks. Technology stocks typically respond more strongly to growth expectations, competitive dynamics, and market sentiment than to interest rate changes. If BNPL stocks trade with similar characteristics, their returns would be driven primarily by factors other than funding costs. This interpretation is consistent with our finding that market returns explain substantially more of BNPL return variation (R² = 0.51 in the full model) than interest rate changes alone.\n\nThird, the relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns may be nonlinear or time-varying. BNPL firms may exhibit sensitivity only when rates cross certain thresholds, or sensitivity patterns may have evolved as the sector matured. Our linear specification cannot capture such patterns, potentially obscuring relationships that exist but are not constant across the sample period.\n\nFourth, there may be a timing mismatch between interest rate changes and stock price responses. Stock prices reflect expectations about future profitability rather than merely current funding costs. If investors have already incorporated anticipated rate changes into prices, or if they focus primarily on longer-term growth prospects, monthly rate changes may not manifest in monthly return data.\n\nWhat does this imply about BNPL stocks?\n\nThe inability to detect a statistically significant relationship does not necessarily imply that BNPL firms are unaffected by interest rates. Rather, it suggests that stock returns do not capture this sensitivity in a manner that is measurable with monthly data. This pattern may indicate that investors treat BNPL stocks as growth-oriented equities rather than rate-sensitive financial instruments, or that other factors—such as market sentiment and competitive dynamics—dominate return variation at monthly frequencies.","type":"content","url":"/dataanalysis#id-4-3-interpreting-the-null-result","position":69},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"4.

This beta is substantially higher than the average stock (which has a beta of approximately 1.0), indicating that BNPL stocks are highly sensitive to systematic market risk.\n\nWhat does high market beta mean? The high market beta suggests that BNPL stocks amplify market movements—they rise more than the market during bull markets and fall more than the market during bear markets. This pattern is consistent with growth-oriented technology stocks, which typically exhibit high betas due to their sensitivity to growth expectations and risk sentiment. The fact that market returns explain 51% of BNPL return variation (R² = 0.51) indicates that systematic market factors dominate BNPL stock performance, while firm-specific or sector-specific factors (including interest rate sensitivity) play a smaller role.\n\nWhy is market beta so high? Several factors may explain BNPL stocks’ high market sensitivity. First, as a relatively new sector, BNPL firms face substantial uncertainty about future growth prospects, making their valuations sensitive to changes in risk sentiment. Second, BNPL stocks may be held by growth-oriented investors who trade based on market sentiment rather than fundamental analysis. Third, the high volatility of BNPL returns may reflect their status as “risk-on” assets that investors buy during optimistic periods and sell during pessimistic periods.\n\nImplications for the interest rate coefficient: The dominance of market returns in explaining BNPL return variation may explain why the interest rate coefficient is not statistically significant. If market movements capture most of the systematic variation in BNPL returns, there may be little residual variation left for interest rates to explain. This does not mean interest rates don’t matter—it means their effects may be indirect (operating through market sentiment) or may be obscured by the dominant market factor.","type":"content","url":"/dataanalysis#id-4-2-market-beta-and-systematic-risk","position":71},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"4.

This represents a substantial improvement, indicating that market returns and macroeconomic factors capture most of the systematic variation in BNPL returns.\n\nAdjusted R²: The adjusted R² accounts for model complexity, penalizing the addition of parameters. The base model’s adjusted R² of 0.0073 is only slightly lower than the unadjusted R², reflecting the model’s simplicity. The full model’s adjusted R² of 0.4696 is substantially lower than the unadjusted R² (0.5098), reflecting the penalty for adding five parameters.

Banks and credit card companies demonstrate clear sensitivity to interest rate changes because their business models depend directly on net interest margins—the spread between lending rates and funding costs. When rates rise, banks’ funding costs increase, but they can pass these costs to borrowers through higher lending rates, maintaining margins. BNPL firms operate under a fundamentally different revenue model, generating income primarily through merchant fees and late payment fees rather than interest rate spreads. This structural difference suggests that BNPL firms should exhibit different sensitivity patterns, and the empirical evidence indicates that investors recognize this difference and price BNPL stocks accordingly.\n\nThe finding that market returns explain substantially more of BNPL return variation (R² = 0.51 in the full model) than interest rate changes indicates that investors treat BNPL stocks as part of the broader equity market rather than as a distinct rate-sensitive sector. This pattern is consistent with viewing BNPL firms as technology-enabled companies that provide credit services, rather than as credit companies that happen to use technology. The high market beta (β = 2.38) further supports this interpretation—BNPL stocks behave like growth-oriented technology stocks, amplifying market movements rather than responding primarily to interest rate changes.\n\nWhat this means: Investors are pricing BNPL stocks based on growth expectations, competitive dynamics, and market sentiment rather than on funding cost sensitivity. This pricing behavior reflects the sector’s status as a growth industry where future prospects matter more than current profitability. The fact that interest rate sensitivity doesn’t show up in stock returns suggests that either (1) investors don’t perceive funding costs as a major risk factor, (2) other factors dominate return variation, or (3) the sensitivity operates through indirect channels that don’t manifest in monthly return data.","type":"content","url":"/dataanalysis#id-5-1-bnpl-as-an-asset-class-growth-stocks-or-financial-stocks","position":79},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"5.

This high beta indicates that BNPL stocks are “risk-on” assets that investors buy during optimistic periods and sell during pessimistic periods.

Fourth, the relationship may be nonlinear or time-varying, requiring longer horizons or different specifications to detect.\n\nImplications: The null result suggests that BNPL stock prices may not efficiently incorporate information about funding cost sensitivity, or that this sensitivity is not a primary driver of returns. This pattern is consistent with growth stock behavior, where investors focus on long-term growth prospects rather than short-term cost factors.","type":"content","url":"/dataanalysis#id-5-3-market-efficiency-and-investor-attention","position":83},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"5.

Discussion: Interpretation and Implications","lvl2":"5.4 Real-World Implications"},"content":"For Investors:\n\nThe high market beta (β = 2.38) has profound implications for portfolio construction and risk management. BNPL stocks amplify market movements by a factor of 2.38, meaning that during a 10% market decline, BNPL stocks would be expected to decline by approximately 24%. This high beta makes BNPL stocks particularly risky during market downturns but potentially rewarding during bull markets. Investors holding BNPL stocks should recognize that they are taking on substantial systematic market risk, not just BNPL-specific risk.\n\nThe lack of significant interest rate sensitivity suggests that investors should focus on market sentiment, competitive dynamics, and regulatory developments rather than attempting to time monetary policy. The high volatility (standard deviation of 12.34% monthly, equivalent to approximately 43% annualized) indicates substantial risk, but this risk comes primarily from market sensitivity rather than interest rate sensitivity. This pattern suggests that BNPL stocks may be suitable for investors seeking exposure to growth-oriented technology sectors but should be avoided by investors seeking defensive positions or interest rate hedging strategies.\n\nThe fact that market returns explain 51% of BNPL return variation indicates that BNPL stocks are highly correlated with broader market movements. This high correlation reduces diversification benefits—BNPL stocks provide little protection during market downturns. However, the remaining 49% of variation reflects BNPL-specific factors (competitive dynamics, regulatory changes, firm-specific news) that may provide opportunities for active management and stock selection.\n\nFor Regulators:\n\nThe finding that BNPL stocks don’t respond significantly to interest rates in monthly data doesn’t mean that funding costs don’t affect BNPL firms’ operations. Firm-level evidence (documented in Section 3) shows that BNPL firms’ funding costs increased substantially as interest rates rose, with Affirm’s funding costs increasing by 394% from 2022 to 2024. This divergence between firm-level profitability and stock-level returns raises important questions about market efficiency and investor attention to fundamental factors.\n\nRegulators should monitor BNPL firms’ funding structures and interest rate risk exposure, particularly given their role in serving subprime consumers who may be vulnerable to economic downturns. The CFPB’s regulatory changes (including the May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit cards) may alter BNPL firms’ sensitivity to monetary policy by changing their funding structures, regulatory compliance costs, and competitive positioning. Regulators should assess how these changes affect BNPL firms’ ability to serve consumers and maintain financial stability.\n\nThe high market beta and volatility of BNPL stocks suggest that these firms may be particularly vulnerable to market disruptions and investor sentiment shifts. Regulators should consider how BNPL firms’ stock performance affects their ability to raise capital and maintain operations, particularly during periods of market stress. The fact that BNPL stocks are priced like growth stocks rather than financial stocks suggests that these firms may face different risk profiles than traditional credit providers.\n\nFor Monetary Policymakers:\n\nThe null result suggests that BNPL firms may represent a distinct channel of monetary policy transmission that operates differently from traditional financial intermediaries. While stock returns don’t show significant sensitivity, firm-level evidence suggests that funding costs do affect BNPL operations. Policymakers should consider how monetary policy affects BNPL firms’ profitability and lending capacity, even if these effects don’t manifest in monthly stock return data.\n\nThe high market beta suggests that monetary policy may affect BNPL firms indirectly through its impact on market sentiment and risk appetite. When the Fed raises rates, it may reduce market risk appetite, causing growth stocks (including BNPL stocks) to decline even if their fundamentals aren’t directly affected. This indirect transmission channel may be as important as direct funding cost effects.\n\nThe finding that inflation is statistically significant (β = -12.94, p-value = 0.049) suggests that monetary policy may affect BNPL firms through inflation channels rather than interest rate channels. Higher inflation erodes consumer purchasing power, reducing BNPL transaction volume, and increases funding costs through its effect on nominal rates. Policymakers should consider how inflation affects BNPL firms’ operations, independent of interest rate effects.\n\nThe substantial variation in interest rate sensitivity across firms (ranging from -5.01 for PayPal to -23.10 for Sezzle) suggests that monetary policy transmission may vary substantially within the BNPL sector. Policymakers should recognize this heterogeneity when assessing how monetary policy affects the sector as a whole.","type":"content","url":"/dataanalysis#id-5-4-real-world-implications","position":85},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"5.

Discussion: Interpretation and Implications","lvl2":"5.5 Economic Interpretation: Why Don’t Stock Prices Reflect Funding Costs?"},"content":"The divergence between firm-level evidence (showing funding cost sensitivity) and stock-level evidence (showing no significant return sensitivity) raises fundamental questions about asset pricing and market efficiency. Several economic mechanisms may explain this pattern:\n\nGrowth Stock Valuation Model: BNPL stocks may be valued using a growth stock model where future growth prospects dominate current profitability. In this framework, investors focus on market share expansion, customer acquisition, and long-term growth potential rather than short-term cost factors. Funding costs may affect profitability, but if investors believe that BNPL firms can grow their way out of cost pressures, stock prices may not respond to funding cost changes.\n\nMarket Sentiment Dominance: The high market beta (2.38) suggests that BNPL stock prices are driven primarily by market sentiment and risk appetite rather than fundamental analysis. During periods of high risk appetite, growth stocks (including BNPL) rise regardless of funding costs. During periods of low risk appetite, growth stocks fall regardless of fundamentals. This sentiment-driven pricing may obscure the relationship between funding costs and stock returns.\n\nAnticipated Effects: Stock prices reflect expectations about future profitability, not just current conditions. If investors anticipated interest rate increases and incorporated them into prices before they materialized, monthly rate changes may not show up in monthly returns. The fact that BNPL stock prices declined substantially during 2022-2023 (when rates rose) suggests that investors did incorporate rate expectations, but this incorporation may have occurred gradually rather than month-by-month.\n\nNonlinear and Time-Varying Relationships: The relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns may be nonlinear or time-varying. BNPL firms may exhibit sensitivity only when rates cross certain thresholds (e.g., above 3% or 4%), or sensitivity patterns may have changed as the sector matured. Our linear specification cannot capture such patterns, potentially obscuring relationships that exist but are not constant.\n\nIndirect Transmission Channels: Interest rates may affect BNPL firms through indirect channels that don’t manifest in monthly return data. Higher rates may reduce consumer spending (affecting BNPL transaction volume), increase credit card competition (making BNPL less attractive), or affect investor risk appetite (reducing demand for growth stocks). These indirect effects may take months or quarters to materialize, requiring longer horizons to detect.","type":"content","url":"/dataanalysis#id-5-5-economic-interpretation-why-dont-stock-prices-reflect-funding-costs","position":87},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"5.

It is possible that funding costs affect profitability in ways that do not manifest in monthly stock returns, either because investors do not incorporate this information efficiently or because other factors dominate price movements.\n\nKey Limitations:\n\nFirst, the limited sample size (67 monthly observations) reduces statistical power to detect relationships. With only 67 observations and multiple regressors, we may fail to reject the null hypothesis even when economically meaningful relationships exist. A larger sample size (e.g., weekly or daily data) would substantially improve statistical power.\n\nSecond, we use Federal Funds Rate changes rather than exogenous monetary policy shocks. Federal Funds Rate changes respond to economic conditions that also affect BNPL returns, creating potential endogeneity. Event studies around FOMC announcements using high-frequency data could provide cleaner identification of causal effects.\n\nThird, the portfolio approach masks firm-level heterogeneity. Individual BNPL firms may exhibit different sensitivity patterns that are obscured by aggregation. Panel data analysis with firm fixed effects could provide more granular insights into heterogeneity across firms.\n\nFourth, we cannot establish causality from observational data alone. Results should be interpreted as associations rather than causal effects. Instrumental variables approaches or natural experiments could provide more credible causal estimates.\n\nFuture Research Directions:\n\nFuture research could examine BNPL firms’ actual financial performance metrics—including revenue growth, profit margins, and credit loss rates—to determine whether the business model exhibits sensitivity to interest rates even if stock prices do not. Such analysis would provide a more complete understanding of how monetary policy affects BNPL firms’ operations, independent of how investors price these effects in equity markets.\n\nEvent studies around FOMC announcements using high-frequency (daily or intraday) data could provide cleaner identification of interest rate effects. By examining stock returns in narrow windows around policy announcements, researchers could isolate the causal effect of monetary policy shocks while controlling for other factors.\n\nPanel data analysis with firm fixed effects could examine heterogeneity across BNPL firms, identifying which firm characteristics (size, funding structure, business model) affect interest rate sensitivity. This would provide insights into why some BNPL firms may be more sensitive than others.\n\nNonlinear and time-varying specifications could examine whether interest rate sensitivity varies across rate levels or time periods. Threshold models or regime-switching models could identify conditions under which BNPL firms exhibit sensitivity.\n\nFinally, research examining the relationship between BNPL firms’ actual profitability and interest rates (using quarterly earnings data) would complement this stock return analysis, providing a more complete picture of how monetary policy affects BNPL firms’ operations.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/dataanalysis#id-5-6-limitations-and-future-research-directions","position":89},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"5.

This substantial variation provides a rich environment for estimating interest rate sensitivity, although identification remains imperfect given the observational nature of the data.\n\nThe research question is motivated by BNPL firms’ unique funding structure—their reliance on warehouse credit facilities, securitization, and sale-and-repurchase agreements creates immediate pass-through of interest rate changes to funding costs, as documented in firm-level analysis of Affirm Holdings Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. 10-K filings.","type":"content","url":"/conclusion#id-5-1-research-question-and-methodology","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"5.

The estimated coefficient (β₁ = -12.68, SE = 9.89, p = 0.202) suggests an economically large but statistically insignificant relationship: a one percentage point increase in the Federal Funds Rate is associated with an estimated 12.7% decrease in log BNPL returns, though the 95% confidence interval [-32.18, 6.81] includes zero.\n\nThis null result reflects three contributing factors: (1) BNPL stocks exhibit extremely high volatility (monthly standard deviation of 12.34%), creating substantial noise that obscures systematic relationships; (2) market returns dominate BNPL return variation, explaining 51% of variation (R² = 0.51) in the full specification model, leaving limited residual variation for interest rates to explain; and (3) Federal Funds Rate changes occur infrequently, with many zero observations creating low-frequency variation that reduces statistical power.\n\nThe full specification model achieves an R² of 0.5098, representing a substantial improvement over the base model’s R² of 0.0224 and demonstrating the value of controlling for market movements and macroeconomic factors. Market returns emerge as the dominant determinant: the market return coefficient (β₅ = 2.38, p < 0.001) indicates that BNPL stocks exhibit a market beta substantially higher than the average stock, placing them among the highest-beta securities in the market. Inflation also exhibits statistically significant effects (β₄ = -12.94, p = 0.049), operating through multiple channels: erosion of consumer purchasing power, increased funding costs, and heightened economic uncertainty.\n\nA noteworthy divergence emerges between firm-level and stock-level evidence. Firm-level analysis demonstrates that funding costs meaningfully affect BNPL operations—Affirm’s funding costs increased by 394% from fiscal year 2022 to 2024, with management attributing this increase primarily to higher benchmark interest rates. Yet stock returns do not exhibit statistically significant sensitivity to interest rate changes. This pattern suggests that BNPL stocks are priced similarly to growth-oriented technology companies rather than rate-sensitive financial institutions, with investors focusing on long-term growth prospects rather than short-term funding cost factors.","type":"content","url":"/conclusion#id-5-2-key-findings","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"5.

Finally, observational data alone cannot establish causality. These limitations require that results be interpreted as exploratory and descriptive rather than definitive causal evidence.\n\nSeveral promising directions for future research emerge. First, as more data becomes available, future studies can examine BNPL interest rate sensitivity with larger sample sizes and greater statistical power. Second, alternative model specifications—including non-linear relationships, lagged effects, and interaction terms—could capture how BNPL sensitivity varies across economic conditions. Third, firm-level panel data could examine how individual BNPL firms’ funding structures, profit margins, and business models affect their sensitivity to interest rate changes.

(PYPL) and Affirm Holdings Inc. (AFRM). This analysis draws directly from annual 10-K filings filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from 2021-2024, providing granular insights into firm-level mechanisms that explain sector-wide patterns.\n\nRationale for Firm Selection:\n\nPayPal and Affirm represent distinct business models within the broader BNPL and digital payments ecosystem, making them useful case studies for understanding how different approaches to BNPL respond to macroeconomic conditions. PayPal, established in 1998, operates a diversified digital payments platform with revenue streams from traditional payment processing, merchant services, and BNPL offerings (notably PayPal Pay in 4, launched in 2020). This diversification means that BNPL represents only a portion of PayPal’s overall business, providing natural hedging against BNPL-specific risks.\n\nAffirm, founded in 2012 and completing its initial public offering in 2021, operates as a pure-play BNPL provider focused exclusively on point-of-sale financing solutions. This focused business model means that Affirm’s performance is more directly tied to BNPL-specific factors, making it a clearer case study for understanding how BNPL firms respond to macroeconomic conditions.\n\nSeveral limitations should be acknowledged. First, examining only two firms limits the generalizability of findings to other BNPL providers or fintech firms. Second, PayPal’s BNPL services represent a relatively small portion of its overall business, making it difficult to isolate BNPL-specific effects from broader PayPal performance. Third, firm-level financial data may be influenced by many factors beyond macroeconomic conditions, including firm-specific strategies, competitive dynamics, management decisions, and regulatory changes.\n\nAffirm Holdings Inc.: Funding Structure and Interest Rate Sensitivity\n\nExamination of Affirm’s 10-K filings from 2021-2024 reveals a business model that is fundamentally dependent on external funding sources with variable interest rates, creating direct exposure to monetary policy changes. According to Affirm’s 2024 10-K filing, the company maintains warehouse credit facilities with aggregate borrowing capacity of approximately $5.0 billion, which mature between 2025 and 2028. These facilities are complemented by securitization programs and forward flow commitments. Critically, these funding sources typically carry variable interest rates tied to benchmark rates such as SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) or LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), though the exact terms vary by facility.\n\nThe impact of interest rate changes on Affirm’s funding costs is reported explicitly in the company’s financial statements. According to Affirm’s 2024 10-K filing, funding costs increased dramatically over the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle. In fiscal year 2022 (ended June 30, 2022), funding costs totaled 69.7 million. This period largely predates the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes that began in March 2022, though some rate increases occurred in the latter part of the fiscal year. In fiscal year 2023 (ended June 30, 2023), funding costs increased to 183.0 million, representing a 163% increase from the prior year. This period overlaps substantially with the Federal Reserve’s rate increases, which raised the federal funds rate from near-zero to approximately 4.5-5.0% by mid-2023. In fiscal year 2024 (ended June 30, 2024), funding costs reached $344.3 million, an 88% increase from fiscal year 2023. The filing explicitly states that this increase was “primarily due to higher benchmark interest rates.” Cumulatively, funding costs increased by approximately 394% from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2024.\n\nThis dramatic escalation in funding costs directly demonstrates the mechanism through which monetary policy affects BNPL firms: as benchmark rates increase, the variable-rate components of Affirm’s funding facilities reset at higher rates, increasing the cost of capital. The 394% increase in funding costs over two years, during a period when the federal funds rate increased from near-zero to over 5%, provides concrete evidence of the direct pass-through mechanism.\n\nHowever, funding costs may be influenced by factors other than interest rates, including changes in the size of the loan portfolio, shifts in the mix of funding sources (warehouse facilities versus securitization), changes in credit spreads, and modifications to facility terms. Management’s attribution of the increase primarily to benchmark rate changes indicates that interest rate movements are a significant driver, though other factors may also play roles.\n\nAffirm’s Loan Portfolio and Receivables:\n\nAffirm’s gross receivables, which represent the principal amount of loans outstanding, declined from 31.0 billion as of June 30, 2023 to 24.6 billion as of June 30, 2024. This decline reflects several factors: portfolio runoff as existing loans mature, tighter underwriting standards in response to higher funding costs or credit concerns, strategic portfolio management decisions, changes in consumer demand for BNPL products, or shifts in merchant partnerships. Without more granular data, it is difficult to determine the relative importance of each factor.\n\nThe vintage composition of the portfolio also matters for interest rate sensitivity. Loans originated during periods of low interest rates (e.g., 2020-2021) may have been priced assuming lower funding costs. When these loans are refinanced or when new loans are originated to replace maturing ones, the higher funding costs reduce margins. However, Affirm’s 10-K filings do not provide detailed vintage analysis that would allow quantification of this effect.\n\nAffirm’s Revenue Growth Relative to Funding Costs:\n\nAffirm’s total revenue (net) increased from 1,349.3 million in fiscal year 2022 to 2,323.0 million in fiscal year 2024, representing a 72% increase over two years. Over the same period, funding costs increased from 69.7 million to 344.3 million, a 394% increase. This divergence indicates that revenue growth alone is not sufficient to offset the margin compression from rising funding costs, at least in the short to medium term.\n\nSeveral caveats are important. First, revenue and funding costs are not directly comparable. Revenue represents gross income while funding costs are one component of expenses. A more appropriate comparison would examine operating margins or net income, which incorporate all expenses. Second, the relationship between revenue and funding costs may be non-linear or subject to lags. Third, Affirm may be able to adjust pricing (merchant fees or consumer interest rates) over time to partially offset funding cost increases, though such adjustments could affect transaction volume. Fourth, revenue growth may reflect factors other than underlying business health, such as one-time gains or accounting changes.\n\nAffirm’s Financial Leverage:\n\nQuantitative examination using data from Yahoo Finance (as of the most recent fiscal year) shows that Affirm exhibits a debt-to-assets ratio of 70.40% and an operating margin of 10.48%. The high debt-to-assets ratio indicates substantial financial leverage, which amplifies the impact of interest rate changes on profitability. Higher leverage means that a given increase in interest expense represents a larger proportion of operating income, making the firm more sensitive to rate movements.\n\nAffirm’s operating margin of 10.48% leaves relatively little buffer to absorb cost increases. However, caution is warranted in drawing strong conclusions from a single point-in-time comparison, as operating margins can vary significantly across business models and may not fully capture the economic sensitivity to interest rates. Additionally, operating margins may be influenced by accounting choices, one-time items, and non-operating factors.\n\nPayPal Holdings Inc.: Diversified Business Model\n\nPayPal operates a more diversified business model than Affirm, with revenue streams from payment processing, merchant services, and other fintech offerings in addition to BNPL services (Pay in 4). This diversification provides natural hedging against BNPL-specific funding cost pressures. If BNPL represents a relatively small portion of PayPal’s overall revenue and operations, then funding cost increases specific to BNPL have a smaller proportional impact on the firm’s overall profitability and stock price.\n\nHowever, PayPal’s 10-K filings do not provide detailed breakdowns of BNPL-specific revenue, costs, or funding structures, making it difficult to quantify the extent of this diversification benefit. Additionally, PayPal’s lower estimated sensitivity in regression analysis could reflect factors other than diversification, such as differences in funding structure, market perceptions, investor composition, or other firm characteristics that cannot be observed directly.\n\nImplications for Understanding BNPL Sector Sensitivity:\n\nThe firm-level evidence presented above demonstrates several mechanisms through which BNPL firms are sensitive to interest rate changes, providing microeconomic foundations for the empirical analysis. First, variable-rate funding facilities create direct exposure to benchmark rate changes, as evidenced by Affirm’s 394% increase in funding costs from 2022 to 2024, which occurred precisely during the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle. This direct pass-through mechanism indicates that interest rate changes have immediate effects on BNPL firms’ cost structures, which are reflected in stock returns. Second, high leverage (as seen in Affirm’s 70.40% debt-to-assets ratio) means that interest expense increases represent a larger proportion of operating income, amplifying the impact on profitability. Third, thin operating margins (Affirm’s 10.48%) leave less buffer to absorb cost increases, meaning that even small increases in funding costs significantly affect profitability. Fourth, in the short term, BNPL providers have limited ability to adjust merchant fees or consumer interest rates to offset funding cost increases, particularly if competitive pressures constrain pricing adjustments.\n\nThese mechanisms collectively provide strong theoretical motivation for expecting negative coefficients on Federal Funds Rate changes in the regression analysis. The documented 394% increase in funding costs, combined with thin margins and high leverage, indicates that BNPL stock returns respond negatively to interest rate increases. However, caution is warranted in drawing strong causal conclusions from firm-level financial data alone, as stock returns are influenced by many factors beyond funding costs, including market sentiment, competitive dynamics, broader economic conditions, and firm-specific news. The regression analysis addresses these concerns by controlling for market returns, consumer confidence, disposable income, and inflation, allowing isolation of the effect of interest rate changes while accounting for other factors that may confound the relationship.\n\nLimitations and Caveats:\n\nSeveral limitations should be acknowledged. First, this analysis focuses on two firms and may not generalize to other BNPL providers or fintech firms. Second, the relationship between funding costs and stock returns may be subject to lags, expectations, and other factors not captured in this analysis. Third, reliance on annual 10-K filings provides snapshots at fiscal year-end and may not capture intra-year dynamics. Fourth, the attribution of funding cost increases to interest rates relies on management’s statements, which may not capture all relevant factors. Fifth, stock returns are influenced by many factors beyond funding costs, including market sentiment, competitive dynamics, broader economic conditions, and firm-specific news. Finally, correlation does not imply causation, and the relationships observed may reflect omitted variables or reverse causality.\n\nSources: Affirm Holdings, Inc. (2024). Annual Report.

For example, consumer prices often increase during holiday shopping seasons, disposable income may show seasonal patterns related to tax refunds or bonus payments, and consumer spending may vary with weather patterns or school calendars. These seasonal patterns are predictable and unrelated to the underlying economic relationships we seek to estimate. If not removed, seasonal patterns can create spurious correlations or mask true relationships between variables.\n\nSeasonal Adjustment Methodology:\n\nWe use seasonally adjusted data from official sources (primarily FRED) where available. The Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database provides many series in both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted forms. FRED uses standard seasonal adjustment procedures, typically the X-13ARIMA-SEATS method developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, which is the industry standard for seasonal adjustment of economic time series.\n\nVariables and Seasonal Adjustment Status:\n\nReal Disposable Personal Income (DSPIC96): Obtained from FRED in seasonally adjusted form by default. This series removes seasonal patterns related to tax refunds, bonus payments, and other predictable income fluctuations.\n\nConsumer Price Index (CPIAUCSLSA): We use the seasonally adjusted version (CPIAUCSLSA) rather than the non-seasonally adjusted version (CPIAUCSL). Seasonal adjustment removes predictable patterns such as holiday shopping effects, seasonal food price variations, and energy price fluctuations related to weather patterns.\n\nConsumer Sentiment (UMCSENT): This survey-based index does not require seasonal adjustment, as it measures consumer expectations rather than actual economic activity that might exhibit seasonal patterns.\n\nFederal Funds Rate (FEDFUNDS): Interest rates do not exhibit predictable seasonal patterns and therefore do not require seasonal adjustment.\n\nStock Returns: Monthly stock returns are already in first-difference form (monthly changes) and do not require seasonal adjustment. While stock markets may exhibit some calendar effects (such as the January effect), these are not predictable seasonal patterns in the same sense as economic time series.\n\nImpact of Seasonal Adjustment:\n\nThe use of seasonally adjusted data ensures that our regression coefficients capture underlying economic relationships. For example, without seasonal adjustment, we might observe a spurious correlation between BNPL returns and CPI driven by holiday shopping patterns (both might increase in December), even if there is no true underlying relationship. By using seasonally adjusted CPI, we isolate the relationship between BNPL returns and underlying inflation trends, rather than seasonal price patterns.\n\nValidation:\n\nThe seasonal adjustment procedures used by FRED are transparent and well-documented. FRED provides both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted versions of many series, allowing researchers to choose the appropriate version for their analysis. For our purposes, using seasonally adjusted data is appropriate because we are interested in underlying economic relationships rather than seasonal patterns.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/appendix#a-2-seasonal-adjustment-data-preprocessing-methodology","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix","lvl2":"A.2 Functional Form Selection: Detailed Justification for Log-Linear Specification"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/appendix#a-2-functional-form-selection-detailed-justification-for-log-linear-specification","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix","lvl2":"A.2 Functional Form Selection: Detailed Justification for Log-Linear Specification"},"content":"The choice of functional form is a critical methodological decision in econometric analysis, as it affects both the interpretation of coefficients and the validity of statistical inference. This section provides a detailed justification for our use of log-transformed BNPL returns as the dependent variable, explaining both the theoretical rationale and the statistical benefits of this specification choice.\n\nTheoretical Motivation\n\nThe log-linear specification is motivated by the multiplicative nature of relationships in financial markets. Equity returns respond proportionally to changes in economic conditions rather than additively, meaning that a given change in an economic variable has a larger absolute effect when returns are high than when returns are low. This proportional relationship is naturally captured by the log transformation, which linearizes multiplicative relationships and allows us to use linear regression methods while maintaining the economic intuition of proportional effects.\n\nEmpirical Benefits\n\nBeyond theoretical considerations, the log transformation provides several empirical advantages that improve the reliability of our statistical inference. First, financial return data commonly exhibit heteroskedasticity, where the variance of error terms varies across observations. This heteroskedasticity violates a key assumption of Ordinary Least Squares regression and can lead to invalid standard errors and incorrect hypothesis tests. Log transformations help stabilize the variance structure by compressing the scale of large returns relative to small returns, reducing the extent of heteroskedasticity and making the data more suitable for regression analysis.\n\nSecond, equity returns often exhibit right-skewed distributions due to the presence of extreme positive returns (outliers). This skewness violates the assumption of normally distributed errors that underlies many statistical tests, potentially leading to incorrect inference. Log transformations help normalize these distributions by compressing extreme values, making the data more symmetric and better approximating the normal distribution assumption.\n\nThird, the log-linear specification facilitates intuitive economic interpretation of regression coefficients. In a log-linear model, each coefficient represents the percentage change in the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding all other variables constant. This elasticity interpretation is particularly valuable for understanding the magnitude of economic effects, as it expresses relationships in percentage terms that are directly comparable across variables with different scales and units of measurement.\n\nMathematical Formulation\n\nThe log transformation we employ is calculated as \\log(1 + R_{t}^{BNPL}/100) \\times 100, where returns are initially expressed as percentages. This formulation ensures that the transformed variable maintains interpretability as a percentage change while benefiting from the properties of the logarithmic transformation. The addition of 1 before taking the logarithm ensures that the transformation is defined for all return values, including negative returns, while the multiplication by 100 restores the percentage scale for ease of interpretation.\n\nRobust Standard Errors\n\nWhile the log transformation helps address heteroskedasticity, we employ robust standard errors (HC3) as an additional safeguard. Robust standard errors provide valid statistical inference even in the presence of heteroskedasticity, ensuring that our hypothesis tests and confidence intervals remain reliable even if the log transformation does not completely eliminate heteroskedasticity. This two-pronged approach—log transformation plus robust standard errors—provides robust protection against the common econometric problems that plague financial return data.\n\nComparison to Alternative Specifications\n\nWe could have used untransformed returns (linear specification) or other transformations, but the log-linear specification provides the best balance of theoretical coherence, empirical fit, and interpretability. Linear specifications would not capture the proportional nature of relationships in financial markets and would be more vulnerable to heteroskedasticity and skewness. Other transformations, such as Box-Cox transformations, could potentially provide better fit but would sacrifice the intuitive elasticity interpretation that makes the log-linear specification particularly valuable for economic analysis.\n\nImportant Note on R² Comparison\n\nWhen comparing log-linear and linear specifications, it is crucial to understand that R² values are not directly comparable between these models. The log-linear model’s R² measures variance explained in log(Y), while the linear model’s R² measures variance explained in Y. These are fundamentally different variables with different variance structures, making direct R² comparison invalid. Log transformation fundamentally alters the variance structure (Var(log(Y)) ≠ Var(Y)), compressing large values and expanding small values, which changes how variance is distributed. Any apparent difference in R² values reflects this structural difference rather than model quality.\n\nWe do not use log transformation to improve R². Instead, we use it for the reasons stated above: addressing heteroskedasticity, normalizing distributions, and enabling elasticity interpretation. When comparing models, what is comparable includes p-values (statistical significance), coefficient estimates, and model diagnostics (residual plots, heteroskedasticity tests). R² values should be interpreted within each model’s context but should not be used to claim that log transformation “improves” model fit.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/appendix#a-2-functional-form-selection-detailed-justification-for-log-linear-specification","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix","lvl2":"EXPLANATION: Chart C - BNPL vs Fintech Lenders Volatility Comparison"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/appendix#explanation-chart-c-bnpl-vs-fintech-lenders-volatility-comparison","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Appendix","lvl2":"EXPLANATION: Chart C - BNPL vs Fintech Lenders Volatility Comparison"},"content":"Chart C compares BNPL stocks to fintech lenders (SoFi, Upstart, Lending Club) rather than the broad market. This provides a more meaningful test of whether BNPL exhibits unique volatility characteristics compared to similar tech-enabled financial services firms.\n\nComparing BNPL to the S&P 500 would be too obvious. Growth-stage fintech firms are expected to be more volatile than the broad market. A more rigorous test is whether BNPL is more volatile than similar fintech lenders that also operate in consumer credit markets.\n\nBoth BNPL and fintech lenders are tech-enabled financial services firms that extend credit to consumers, but they differ in business models. BNPL focuses on point-of-sale installment loans, while fintech lenders offer personal loans and other credit products. If BNPL is more volatile than these peers, it suggests BNPL-specific factors (e.g., sensitivity to interest rates, business model fragility) rather than just being a growth-stage fintech firm.\n\nWe calculate two separate average return series using only US publicly traded companies. For the Average BNPL Return, we take the simple average of monthly stock returns across three BNPL firms: PayPal (PYPL), Affirm (AFRM), and Sezzle (SEZL).\n\nFirm Selection Rationale for BNPL Group: We initially attempted to include five BNPL firms (PayPal, Block/Afterpay, Affirm, Klarna, and Sezzle) to capture approximately 95% of US BNPL market share. However, data availability constraints required us to exclude two firms. Block/Afterpay (SQ) was excluded due to data retrieval issues from Yahoo Finance during the analysis period. Klarna (KLAR) was excluded because it completed its initial public offering in September 2025, after our sample period ends in August 2025, making historical trading data unavailable for the full analysis window. The three firms included (PayPal, Affirm, and Sezzle) represent substantial BNPL market coverage. PayPal’s BNPL product (Pay in 4) represents 68.1% of US BNPL market share, making it the largest BNPL provider. Affirm is a pure-play BNPL provider that went public in 2021 and represents a significant portion of the market. Sezzle is also a pure-play BNPL provider that went public in 2020. Together, these three firms provide comprehensive coverage of the BNPL sector while ensuring data availability throughout the entire sample period.\n\nFor the Average Fintech Lenders Return, we take the simple average of monthly stock returns across three fintech lenders: SoFi (SOFI), Upstart (UPST), and Lending Club (LC).\n\nFirm Selection Rationale for Fintech Lenders Group: We selected these three firms because they are US publicly traded tech-enabled consumer credit firms that operate in consumer lending markets, making them comparable to BNPL firms while representing a different business model. SoFi (SOFI) is a digital financial services company that offers personal loans, student loan refinancing, and other consumer credit products. Upstart (UPST) is an AI-powered lending platform that partners with banks to provide personal loans and other credit products. Lending Club (LC) is a peer-to-peer lending platform that facilitates personal loans. All three firms are publicly traded, have sufficient trading history covering our sample period (February 2020 to August 2025), and operate in consumer credit markets similar to BNPL firms but with different business models (personal loans rather than point-of-sale installment loans). Both groups consist of US publicly traded, tech-enabled financial services firms that extend credit to consumers, making them comparable for volatility analysis.\n\nFor each month, we download stock prices for each firm, calculate monthly returns as (Price_end_of_month - Price_start_of_month) / Price_start_of_month × 100%, then average within each group. We repeat this process for every month, creating a series of monthly average returns. The chart connects these monthly averages with lines, creating two time series: one for BNPL returns and one for fintech lender returns.\n\nAveraging reduces noise from firm-specific events. If we plotted individual firms, one firm’s idiosyncratic news (e.g., Affirm’s earnings beat) would dominate. By averaging, we capture the sector-wide pattern: how BNPL as a sector responds to market conditions versus how fintech lenders as a sector respond. This allows us to test whether BNPL’s business model (as a sector) exhibits different volatility characteristics than fintech lenders’ business models (as a sector).\n\nThe volatility ratio is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of BNPL returns (σ_BNPL) by the standard deviation of fintech lender returns (σ_Fintech): volatility_ratio = σ_BNPL / σ_Fintech. If this ratio exceeds 1.0, BNPL is more volatile than fintech lenders. A ratio significantly above 1.0 (e.g., >1.5x) suggests BNPL-specific factors drive higher volatility beyond what is typical for fintech lenders.\n\nWe calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the monthly returns of the average BNPL stocks and average fintech lenders using pandas’ .corr() method. This measures the linear relationship between the two return series. A high positive correlation (e.g., >0.7) would indicate both move together, suggesting common factors (e.g., tech sector sentiment, regulatory changes) drive both. A moderate correlation (e.g., 0.4-0.7) suggests some common factors but also BNPL-specific drivers. A low correlation (<0.4) would indicate BNPL and fintech lenders respond to different factors.\n\nEmpirical Results: The analysis reveals that BNPL exhibits a monthly volatility (standard deviation) of 20.46%, while fintech lenders show a slightly higher volatility of 22.31%. This results in a volatility ratio of 0.92x, indicating that BNPL is actually slightly less volatile than fintech lenders, contrary to initial expectations. The Pearson correlation coefficient between BNPL and fintech lender returns is 0.507, indicating a moderate positive correlation. This suggests that while both sectors share common drivers (likely tech sector sentiment and broader market conditions), BNPL also exhibits sector-specific factors that cause it to diverge from fintech lenders at times. The moderate correlation, combined with BNPL’s comparable volatility to fintech lenders, suggests that BNPL’s risk profile is similar to other tech-enabled consumer credit firms, rather than being uniquely volatile.\n\nThe blue line shows BNPL returns, which exhibit extreme swings. The yellow line shows fintech lender returns, which exhibit similar volatility patterns. The visual contrast and volatility metrics quantify the relationship between these two sectors.\n\nIf BNPL is significantly more volatile than fintech lenders (despite similar business models), this supports our hypothesis that BNPL’s business model (reliance on cheap capital, thin margins) makes it uniquely sensitive to interest rate changes. If BNPL is more volatile than fintech lenders, this suggests BNPL-specific factors (e.g., interest rate sensitivity) rather than just being a growth-stage tech firm. This provides preliminary evidence supporting our hypothesis that BNPL is uniquely sensitive to rate changes.\n\nHowever, this chart alone cannot establish causation. The regression analysis in Model 2 will test whether BNPL’s higher volatility is specifically driven by interest rate sensitivity after controlling for market movements and other factors. Chart B showed a negative relationship between rate changes and BNPL returns, but that simple model suffered from omitted variable bias. Chart C shows whether BNPL is more volatile than similar firms, providing context for interpreting Chart B’s results. If BNPL is more volatile than fintech lenders and Chart B shows BNPL responds negatively to rate changes, this suggests BNPL-specific rate sensitivity. Model 2 (multi-factor regression) will formally test this by controlling for market returns and isolating BNPL-specific sensitivity to rates.\n\n# ============================================================================\n# CHART C: BNPL vs Fintech Lenders Volatility Comparison\n# ============================================================================\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport yfinance as yf\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.dates as mdates\n\n# Set style with better readability\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid')\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Configure matplotlib for better readability\nplt.rcParams.update({\n    'font.size': 12,\n    'axes.labelsize': 15,\n    'axes.titlesize': 17,\n    'xtick.labelsize': 12,\n    'ytick.labelsize': 12,\n    'legend.fontsize': 13,\n    'figure.titlesize': 18\n})\n\nprint(\"Creating Chart C: BNPL vs Fintech Lenders Volatility Comparison...\")\n\ntry:\n    # BNPL tickers -

BNPL vs Credit Card Companies Volatility Comparison"},"content":"Chart D compares BNPL stocks to credit card companies to address a key research question: Is BNPL’s surge a threat to traditional credit card companies, or is this concern overblown?\n\nThis comparison tests whether BNPL exhibits different volatility patterns than established credit providers. BNPL and credit cards are both consumer credit products, but they operate under different business models.\n\nCredit card companies (Capital One, Synchrony Financial, American Express) are mature, established financial institutions with diversified revenue streams (interest income, fees, merchant processing). BNPL firms are newer, growth-stage companies focused primarily on point-of-sale installment loans.\n\nIf BNPL is significantly more volatile than credit card companies, it suggests BNPL may face unique risks that could limit its ability to compete with or replace traditional credit cards. Conversely, if BNPL volatility is similar to credit cards, it suggests BNPL may be a viable alternative.\n\nRecent trends show BNPL gaining market share, especially among younger consumers. During the 2024 holiday season, 54% of Gen Z consumers used BNPL services, compared to 50% who used credit cards (Retail Dive, 2024). However, credit cards remain dominant. Seventy-six percent of US adults had at least one credit card in 2025 (Coin Law, 2025).\n\nThis chart helps assess whether BNPL’s volatility characteristics suggest it can sustainably compete with credit cards or if concerns about BNPL replacing credit cards are overblown.\n\nWe calculate two separate average return series.

Klarna (KLAR) was excluded because it completed its initial public offering in September 2025, after our sample period ends in August 2025, making historical trading data unavailable for the full analysis window. The three firms included (PayPal, Affirm, and Sezzle) represent substantial BNPL market coverage. PayPal’s BNPL product (Pay in 4) represents 68.1% of US BNPL market share, making it the largest BNPL provider. Affirm is a pure-play BNPL provider that went public in 2021 and represents a significant portion of the market. Sezzle is also a pure-play BNPL provider that went public in 2020. Together, these three firms provide comprehensive coverage of the BNPL sector while ensuring data availability throughout the entire sample period.\n\nFor the Average Credit Card Companies Return, we take the simple average of monthly stock returns across three credit card companies: Capital One (COF), Synchrony Financial (SYF), and American Express (AXP).\n\nFirm Selection Rationale for Credit Card Companies Group: We selected these three firms because they are US publicly traded credit card companies that represent different segments of the credit card market, providing comprehensive coverage of established credit card providers. Capital One (COF) is a major bank holding company that issues credit cards and operates as one of the largest credit card issuers in the United States. Synchrony Financial (SYF) is a consumer financial services company that specializes in private-label credit cards and co-branded credit cards, partnering with retailers and other businesses. American Express (AXP) is a diversified financial services company that issues charge cards and credit cards, operating both as a card issuer and a payment network. All three firms are publicly traded, have sufficient trading history covering our sample period (February 2020 to August 2025), and represent different business models within the credit card industry (general-purpose cards, private-label cards, and charge cards). Both groups consist of US publicly traded companies that provide consumer credit, making them comparable for volatility analysis.\n\nEach point on the chart represents one month’s sector average return. We calculate monthly returns for each stock as (Price_end_of_month - Price_start_of_month) / Price_start_of_month × 100%, then average within each group. We repeat this process for every month, creating two time series: one for BNPL returns and one for credit card company returns. The chart connects these monthly averages with lines, allowing visual comparison of volatility patterns between the two sectors.\n\nEmpirical Results: The analysis reveals that BNPL exhibits significantly higher volatility than credit card companies, with a monthly volatility (standard deviation) of 20.46% compared to credit card companies’ volatility of 9.93%. This results in a volatility ratio of 2.06x, indicating that BNPL is more than twice as volatile as established credit card companies. The Pearson correlation coefficient between BNPL and credit card company returns is 0.537, indicating a moderate positive correlation. This suggests that while both sectors share some common drivers (likely broader financial market conditions and consumer credit trends), BNPL exhibits substantially higher volatility, reflecting investor perceptions of greater risk. The 2.06x volatility ratio suggests that BNPL faces unique risks, such as interest rate sensitivity, business model fragility, and regulatory uncertainty, that may limit its ability to sustainably compete with traditional credit cards. This higher volatility could affect BNPL’s cost of capital and long-term viability, potentially constraining its growth potential relative to established credit providers.\n\nIf BNPL is significantly more volatile than credit card companies, it suggests BNPL faces unique risks (e.g., interest rate sensitivity, business model fragility, regulatory uncertainty) that may limit its ability to sustainably compete with credit cards. Higher volatility could indicate investors perceive BNPL as riskier, which could affect BNPL’s cost of capital and long-term viability. Conversely, if BNPL volatility is similar to credit cards, it suggests BNPL may be a viable alternative to credit cards, supporting the view that BNPL could be a meaningful threat to traditional credit card companies.\n\nUnderstanding BNPL’s volatility relative to credit cards helps assess how investors perceive BNPL’s risk relative to established credit providers, whether BNPL’s business model can sustain long-term competition with credit cards, and what policy implications arise from BNPL’s risk profile. This analysis provides important context for evaluating BNPL’s role in the consumer credit market and its potential impact on traditional financial institutions.\n\n# ============================================================================\n# CHART D: BNPL vs Credit Card Companies Volatility Comparison\n# ============================================================================\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport yfinance as yf\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.dates as mdates\n\n# Set style with better readability\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid')\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Configure matplotlib for better readability\nplt.rcParams.update({\n    'font.size': 12,\n    'axes.labelsize': 15,\n    'axes.titlesize': 17,\n    'xtick.labelsize': 12,\n    'ytick.labelsize': 12,\n    'legend.fontsize': 13,\n    'figure.titlesize': 18\n})\n\nprint(\"Creating Chart D: BNPL vs Credit Card Companies Volatility Comparison...\")\n\ntry:\n    # BNPL tickers -

Limitations","lvl2":"7.1 Sample Size Constraints"},"content":"Our analysis uses 67 monthly observations spanning February 2020 to August 2025. This limited sample size creates several challenges:\n\nStatistical Power: With only 67 observations and multiple regressors (5-6 variables in the full specification), statistical power is substantially reduced. This makes it difficult to detect effects that may be economically meaningful but statistically weak. The wide confidence intervals around our coefficient estimates (e.g., the 95% confidence interval for the interest rate coefficient ranges from -32.4 to 7.0) reflect this limited power. As a result, we cannot confidently reject the null hypothesis of no relationship even if a meaningful economic relationship exists.\n\nCoefficient Stability: Small sample sizes lead to unstable coefficient estimates that are sensitive to individual observations. Outliers or unusual periods can substantially affect point estimates, making it difficult to distinguish signal from noise. We address this concern by using robust standard errors (HC3) and conducting outlier analysis, but the fundamental limitation remains.\n\nFuture Research: Future research should use higher-frequency data (weekly or daily) or event-study approaches around FOMC announcements to substantially increase sample size. Weekly data would provide approximately 260 observations over the same period, dramatically improving statistical power. Event studies focusing on FOMC announcement days could provide cleaner identification with narrower windows around policy changes.","type":"content","url":"/limitations#id-7-1-sample-size-constraints","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"7.

This measure has significant limitations:\n\nEndogeneity: \\Delta FFR captures both exogenous policy shocks and endogenous responses to economic conditions. The Federal Reserve adjusts rates in response to inflation, unemployment, and other economic indicators that also affect BNPL firms, creating potential omitted variable bias.\n\nNot a Clean Shock: Modern monetary policy research uses high-frequency identification around FOMC announcements (Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson 2005), narrative shocks (Romer and Romer 2004), or term structure movements to isolate exogenous policy changes. Our monthly \\Delta FFR measure does not provide this clean identification.\n\nMeasurement Error: Monthly aggregation may miss important intra-month variation in policy expectations and market responses.\n\nAlternative Approaches: Ideally, we would use:\n\nHigh-frequency event studies around FOMC announcements (30-minute windows)\n\n2-year Treasury yield changes (better capture policy expectations)\n\nNarrative shocks or Jarociński-Karadi identification\n\nShadow rates (Wu-Xia) for periods near the zero lower bound\n\nAs a robustness check, we examine specifications using 2-year Treasury yield changes, which better capture policy expectations, but acknowledge that this still does not provide the clean identification available from high-frequency event studies.","type":"content","url":"/limitations#id-7-2-shock-identification-limitations","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"7.

Different firms have different funding structures (e.g., Klarna’s deposit-based model vs. Affirm’s wholesale funding), business models, and regulatory environments that may affect interest rate sensitivity differently.\n\nLimited Firm Coverage: Our sample includes only three publicly-traded BNPL firms, which may not represent the broader BNPL sector.
