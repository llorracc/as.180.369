## 1. Introduction and Research Question

**How do BNPL firms' stock returns respond to changes in the Federal Funds Rate, after controlling for market-wide movements and macroeconomic factors?**

This is the question this paper answers. BNPL firms operate differently from traditional banks: they rely on wholesale funding (warehouse credit facilities, securitization, commercial paper) rather than consumer deposits, and they operate with thin profit margins. When interest rates rise, their funding costs increase immediately, and those thin margins mean even small cost increases can eliminate profitability. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reports that BNPL unit margins declined from 1.27% in 2020 to 1.01% in 2021—a 20% compression in a single year. This suggests BNPL firms should be sensitive to interest rate changes, but we don't have quantitative evidence on how their stock returns actually respond.

This question matters because BNPL has grown rapidly (from USD 2 billion in GMV in 2019 to USD 24.2 billion in 2021), and understanding how these firms respond to monetary policy helps investors assess risk and helps policymakers understand financial stability implications. Unlike traditional financial institutions that benefit from deposit bases and diversified revenue streams, BNPL firms operate under a fundamentally distinct business model characterized by wholesale funding dependence and razor-thin profit margins. This structural difference suggests they may exhibit different sensitivity to interest rate changes compared to traditional financial stocks.

### 1.1 Market Context

The U.S. BNPL market has grown rapidly: 21% of consumers with credit records used BNPL in 2022, and adoption continues expanding. However, this growth comes with risks. About 61% of BNPL borrowers have subprime credit scores, and 34-41% report late payments. This customer base—financially constrained consumers with high debt burdens—suggests BNPL firms are vulnerable to economic shocks. When interest rates rise or consumer spending falls, these borrowers are more likely to default, directly affecting BNPL profitability.

### 1.2 Klarna Case Study: A Preview

Klarna's IPO in September 2025 offers a concrete example of BNPL sensitivity to interest rates. The company's valuation collapsed from USD 46 billion in 2021 to USD 13-14 billion by 2025—a 70% decline that coincided precisely with the Fed's rate hikes from near-zero to 5%. This happened despite continued revenue growth, suggesting the collapse reflected investor concerns about profitability in a higher-rate environment, not operational failure.

**Important caveat:** Klarna operates under a European banking license and funds loans through consumer deposits, unlike most U.S. BNPL firms that rely on wholesale funding. This means Klarna's sensitivity profile differs from firms like Affirm or PayPal. The case study illustrates the general principle that BNPL valuations respond to interest rates, but the specific mechanisms may vary by funding structure.


## 1.2 Research Contribution

This study contributes to three distinct strands of literature: fintech valuation, monetary policy transmission, and consumer credit markets. A detailed discussion of these contributions and the specific gaps in existing research that this study addresses is provided in Section 2.6 (Literature Review).

## 1.3 Methodology Overview

The study employs a multi-factor regression framework that extends beyond simple bivariate relationships to control for confounding factors and isolate BNPL-specific sensitivity to interest rates. The econometric specification addresses several identification challenges inherent in time series analysis of financial returns, including endogeneity concerns, omitted variable bias, and reverse causality. The framework draws on established methods in financial econometrics, adapting techniques developed for analyzing bank stock returns and monetary policy transmission to the unique characteristics of BNPL firms.

The analysis employs a two-stage modeling approach. The base model specification takes the following form:$$\log(BNPL\_Return_t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \Delta FFR_t + \varepsilon_t$$where $\log(BNPL\_Return_t)$ represents the log-transformed monthly BNPL stock return calculated as an equally-weighted portfolio of publicly-traded BNPL firms, calculated as $\log(1 + BNPL\_Return_t/100)$, and $\Delta FFR_t$ denotes the month-over-month change in the Federal Funds Rate.

The full specification model extends this framework by incorporating additional control variables:$$\log(BNPL\_Return_t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \Delta FFR_t + \beta_2 \Delta CC_t + \beta_3 \Delta DI_t + \beta_4 \Delta \pi_t + \beta_5 R_{Market,t} + \varepsilon_t$$where $\Delta CC_t$ captures month-over-month changes in the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, $\Delta DI_t$ represents month-over-month percentage changes in real disposable personal income, $\Delta \pi_t$ denotes month-over-month percentage changes in the Consumer Price Index (inflation), and $R_{Market,t}$ represents the monthly return on the S&P 500 index (SPY) as a proxy for systematic market risk.

The use of log-transformed returns facilitates elasticity interpretation of coefficients while addressing heteroskedasticity and distributional skewness common in financial return data. This transformation is standard in financial econometrics and allows coefficients to be interpreted as approximate percentage changes in returns per unit change in the independent variables. Estimation employs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) with robust standard errors using the Huber-White HC3 specification, which accounts for heteroskedasticity and potential outliers common in financial returns data. The choice of HC3 standard errors is particularly important given the relatively small sample size of 67 monthly observations. MacKinnon and White demonstrate that HC3 standard errors perform better than HC0 or HC1 specifications in small samples, providing more accurate inference in finite samples (MacKinnon and White). This methodological choice reflects careful attention to the statistical properties of our data and ensures robust inference despite the limited sample size.

The analysis conducts comprehensive model diagnostics including multicollinearity checks through correlation matrices, variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis, outlier detection using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, residual analysis, and heteroskedasticity tests. The study reports multiple model fit statistics including R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, F-statistic, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance and diagnostic validity.

Data collection draws from authoritative sources including the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API for macroeconomic indicators and Yahoo Finance for financial market data. The sample period spans February 2020 to August 2025, comprising 67 monthly observations that capture the rapid growth phase of the BNPL industry alongside dramatic monetary policy shifts from near-zero rates to approximately 5%.

This period provides substantial variation in the key explanatory variable (Federal Funds Rate), which is essential for estimating associations between interest rates and BNPL returns. The Federal Reserve's transition from accommodative monetary policy (near-zero rates) to restrictive policy (approximately 5%) over the sample period provides substantial variation that allows us to examine how BNPL stock returns are associated with dramatic shifts in funding costs. BNPL firms included in the analysis comprise Affirm Holdings (AFRM), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), and Sezzle (SEZL), selected based on criteria established in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Market Trends Report (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, "Buy Now, Pay Later"). These firms represent substantial market coverage, with PayPal's BNPL product (Pay in 4) representing 68.1% of US BNPL market share, making it the largest BNPL provider. Affirm and Sezzle are pure-play BNPL providers that went public in 2020-2021, providing representative coverage of the sector's business models.
