This study examines the relationship between Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) firms' stock returns and changes in monetary policy, specifically the Federal Funds Rate, addressing a fundamental gap in the financial economics literature on fintech firm valuation and monetary policy transmission mechanisms.

I employ a multi-factor regression framework with robust standard errors (HC3) to estimate the relationship between log-transformed BNPL stock returns and interest rate changes while controlling for market movements, consumer spending patterns, credit market conditions, and macroeconomic factors. The econometric specification employs a two-stage approach, beginning with a parsimonious base model and progressing to a full specification that incorporates multiple economic channels simultaneously. The analysis spans February 2020 to August 2025, comprising 67 monthly observations that capture the rapid growth phase of the BNPL industry alongside significant monetary policy shifts from near-zero rates to approximately 5%. This period provides substantial variation in the key explanatory variable, creating a natural experiment for examining how BNPL firms respond to rate changes.

The results show a negative relationship between interest rate changes and BNPL returns, with an estimated coefficient of β₁ = -12.68 in the full specification model. This indicates that a one percentage point increase in Federal Funds Rate changes is associated with approximately a 12.7% decrease in log BNPL returns. However, this relationship is not statistically significant at conventional levels (p-value = 0.202), indicating that I cannot reject the null hypothesis that BNPL stock returns are insensitive to interest rate changes. The full specification model achieves an R² of 0.5098, indicating that the included variables collectively explain approximately 51% of the variation in log BNPL returns, representing a substantial improvement over the base model's R² of 0.0224.

This research contributes to three distinct strands of literature: fintech firm valuation, monetary policy transmission mechanisms, and consumer credit markets research. The study provides empirical evidence on how alternative credit providers respond to macroeconomic conditions, contributing to the broader understanding of how fintech firms differ from traditional financial institutions in their response to monetary policy changes.
