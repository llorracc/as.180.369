## 1. Introduction and Research Question

## 1.1 Research Question

The emergence of Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) as a significant alternative credit provision mechanism raises fundamental questions about how these firms respond to macroeconomic shocks, particularly monetary policy changes. Unlike traditional financial institutions that benefit from deposit bases and diversified revenue streams, BNPL firms operate under a distinct business model characterized by wholesale funding dependence and thin profit margins. Wholesale funding refers to borrowing from capital markets through instruments such as warehouse credit facilities, securitization, and commercial paper, rather than relying on consumer deposits. This structural difference creates different sensitivity to interest rate changes compared to traditional financial stocks, though empirical evidence quantifying this relationship remains limited.

The primary research question is: How do BNPL firms' stock returns respond to changes in the Federal Funds Rate, after controlling for market-wide movements and macroeconomic factors? This question emerges from the theoretical observation that BNPL firms' funding structure creates immediate pass-through of monetary policy changes to their cost of capital, while their thin operating margins amplify the impact of funding cost increases on profitability. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Market Trends Report provides empirical context for this question. BNPL Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) grew from USD 2 billion in 2019 to USD 24.2 billion in 2021, representing a 1,092% compound annual growth rate. However, unit margins declined from 1.27% in 2020 to 1.01% in 2021, representing a 20% margin compression over a single year. This margin compression demonstrates vulnerability to cost increases: even small increases in funding costs can eliminate already-thin profit margins, making BNPL firms particularly sensitive to interest rate changes (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, "Buy Now, Pay Later").

## 1.1.1 U.S. BNPL Market Context and Growth Statistics

The U.S. BNPL market has experienced rapid expansion, with adoption accelerating significantly in recent years. According to recent market analysis, North America (primarily the United States) accounted for approximately 29-32% of global BNPL provider revenue in 2024, ranking among the top regions by provider earnings (Emewulu). U.S. BNPL user adoption has grown substantially, expanding from 86.5 million users in 2024 to a projected 91.5 million users in 2025, reflecting annual growth of approximately 6-7% (Emewulu).

Consumer adoption patterns reveal important insights into BNPL usage in the United States. Empirical estimates indicate that 21% of U.S. consumers with a credit record financed at least one purchase using BNPL from one of the six major providers (Affirm, Afterpay, Klarna, PayPal, Sezzle, and Zip) in 2022. The average purchase amount was USD 142 and the median purchase amount was USD 108 (Emewulu). The average annual BNPL originations per borrower increased from 8.5 loans in 2021 to 9.5 loans in 2022, indicating intensifying usage patterns among existing users (Emewulu).

However, this rapid growth has been accompanied by concerning patterns of consumer financial stress and overextension. Approximately 34-41% of BNPL users reported making late payments in the past year, with Gen Z users showing a higher delinquency rate of 51% (Emewulu). This raises concerns about consumer debt and repayment capacity. Loan stacking (the practice of holding multiple BNPL loans simultaneously) has become prevalent. Sixty-three percent of BNPL borrowers originated multiple simultaneous loans in 2022, and 33% held loans across multiple BNPL providers (Emewulu). This creates hidden debt exposure that is not visible to traditional credit reporting systems. This pattern of multiple concurrent loans across providers indicates that consumers are using BNPL to manage cash flow constraints, amplifying financial vulnerability.

The demographic and credit profile of U.S. BNPL users further highlights the sector's sensitivity to economic conditions. Approximately 61% of U.S. BNPL borrowers fall into subprime or deep subprime credit categories. These users exhibit average credit card utilization rates of 60-66%, compared to 34% for non-BNPL users (Emewulu). High credit card utilization rates (60-66%) suggest high debt burdens relative to available credit, signaling financial stress and limited capacity to absorb additional costs. This high utilization rate, combined with the prevalence of loan stacking, indicates that BNPL users are particularly vulnerable to interest rate increases and economic shocks. They have limited financial buffers and higher existing debt burdens. These patterns support the theoretical prediction that BNPL firms' stock returns exhibit sensitivity to monetary policy changes. The customer base consists disproportionately of financially constrained consumers who reduce spending and increase defaults when interest rates rise.

PayPal's BNPL service demonstrates particularly high adoption in the U.S. market. Sixty-eight percent of surveyed U.S. online shoppers reported having used PayPal's BNPL service at least once in 2025, placing it among the most widely adopted BNPL brands in the country (Emewulu). This high adoption rate reflects PayPal's established position in the digital payments ecosystem and its integration with existing merchant networks. It also indicates that PayPal's BNPL operations are particularly sensitive to changes in consumer spending patterns and credit conditions.

Regulatory developments in the United States are also shaping the BNPL landscape. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed new rules for 2025 that would mandate credit bureau reporting for BNPL loans, require clearer disclosures, and enhance consumer protections to surface hidden debt and strengthen oversight (Emewulu). These regulatory changes will affect BNPL firms' business models and profitability. They will reduce adoption among subprime borrowers who represent a significant share of current users, while also improving transparency and reducing hidden debt accumulation.

## 1.1.2 Klarna's Initial Public Offering: A Case Study in Interest Rate Sensitivity

Klarna's initial public offering in September 2025 provides a revealing case study of BNPL firms' sensitivity to monetary policy changes, offering insights that complement traditional regression analysis. The IPO demonstrates how interest rate environments reshape BNPL firm valuations and market access.

**Valuation Collapse During Monetary Policy Tightening:** The most striking evidence of BNPL firms' interest rate sensitivity emerges from Klarna's valuation trajectory. The company achieved a peak private market valuation of approximately USD 46 billion in June 2021, during a period of near-zero interest rates and accommodative monetary policy. However, by the time of its September 2025 IPO, Klarna's valuation had collapsed to approximately USD 13-14 billion, a decline of roughly 70% over a four-year period that precisely coincided with the Federal Reserve's most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle since the 1980s (Klarna Group plc, Form F-1). This valuation collapse occurred despite Klarna's continued revenue growth and expanding market presence, indicating that the deterioration was driven not by operational failures but by fundamental shifts in the cost of capital and investor expectations regarding profitability in a higher interest rate environment. The magnitude and timing of this valuation decline provide compelling evidence that BNPL firms' valuations are highly sensitive to interest rate environments, with investor expectations adjusting systematically as monetary policy conditions change.

The timing of this valuation collapse provides compelling evidence for the theoretical prediction that BNPL firms exhibit heightened sensitivity to monetary policy changes. The period from 2021 to 2025 witnessed the Federal Funds Rate increase from near-zero to approximately 5%, providing substantial variation in monetary policy conditions that allows examination of BNPL firms' resilience to funding cost increases. Klarna's valuation trajectory demonstrates that private market investors systematically revised their expectations downward as interest rates rose, reflecting concerns about the sector's ability to maintain profitability when funding costs increase. This pattern is consistent with the CFPB's documentation that BNPL firms operate with thin profit margins (provider revenues represent only about 4% of gross merchandise volume), making them particularly vulnerable to funding cost increases that compress already-narrow margins. The systematic nature of this valuation adjustment, occurring across multiple funding rounds and investor classes, indicates that the relationship between interest rates and BNPL firm valuations reflects fundamental economic forces rather than coincidental timing.

**IPO Timing as a Signal of Funding Market Constraints:** The decision to pursue an IPO in September 2025, after the valuation collapse, demonstrates how interest rate environments affect BNPL firms' access to capital. Private market investors, who had previously supported Klarna at valuations exceeding USD 40 billion, became unwilling or unable to provide additional capital at previous valuation levels once interest rates rose. The IPO represents a shift from private to public markets, reflecting the need for liquidity among early investors who could no longer exit through private market transactions, or the company's need to access public equity markets when private funding became constrained by higher cost of capital expectations. This transition illustrates how monetary policy affects BNPL firms not only through direct funding costs but also through capital market access and investor risk preferences, highlighting the multi-channel nature of monetary policy transmission to fintech firms.

This transition from private to public markets during a period of monetary policy tightening demonstrates that BNPL firms face not only direct funding cost pressures but also indirect constraints on their ability to raise capital. When interest rates rise, private market investors become more risk-averse and demand higher expected returns, making it more difficult for BNPL firms to raise capital at attractive valuations. The IPO timing serves as a signal that the interest rate environment fundamentally altered the capital market conditions under which BNPL firms can operate, forcing a transition to public markets that provides more transparent pricing but also exposes the firms to greater scrutiny regarding their interest rate sensitivity. This dynamic illustrates how monetary policy transmission operates through both direct cost channels and indirect capital market access channels, creating multiple pathways through which interest rate changes affect BNPL firm valuations.

**The Banking License Model: A Different Sensitivity Profile:** Klarna's funding structure introduces an important nuance to understanding BNPL firms' interest rate sensitivity. Unlike most BNPL providers that rely on wholesale funding markets (warehouse credit facilities, securitization, and commercial paper), Klarna operates under a European banking license that allows it to fund BNPL loans through approximately USD 9.5 billion in consumer deposits (Klarna Group plc, Form F-1). This deposit-based funding model creates a different interest rate sensitivity profile compared to wholesale-funded BNPL firms.

Deposit-funded institutions typically exhibit less immediate sensitivity to Federal Funds Rate changes because consumer deposits are relatively "sticky"—consumers do not immediately withdraw deposits when interest rates rise, and deposit rates adjust more slowly than wholesale funding rates. However, deposit-funded BNPL firms face different pressures. They must compete for deposits by offering competitive deposit rates, and they are subject to regulatory capital requirements (such as Basel III) that constrain lending capacity during periods of economic stress. This indicates that Klarna exhibits different sensitivity patterns than wholesale-funded BNPL firms like Affirm or PayPal, with less immediate pass-through of Federal Funds Rate changes but greater sensitivity to deposit rate competition and regulatory capital constraints. This heterogeneity in funding structures across BNPL firms means that interest rate sensitivity varies substantially within the sector, depending on each firm's specific funding model and regulatory environment.

**Is This a Bubble? A Fundamental Mismatch Rather Than Speculation:** The dramatic valuation decline raises the question of whether BNPL represented a speculative bubble that has now corrected. The evidence indicates a more nuanced interpretation. Rather than a traditional bubble driven by irrational speculation, Klarna's valuation trajectory reflects a fundamental mismatch between business model viability and interest rate environment. The valuation collapse occurred not because investors suddenly realized that BNPL was worthless, but because rising interest rates fundamentally altered the economics of the business model.

BNPL firms' thin profit margins, combined with their reliance on short-term funding markets, create inherent vulnerability to interest rate increases. When rates were near zero, these firms could operate profitably despite thin margins. However, when the Federal Funds Rate rose to approximately 5%, funding costs increased substantially, compressing margins and making profitability more difficult to achieve. The valuation collapse thus reflects not a bubble bursting but a fundamental reassessment of business model viability in a higher interest rate environment. This interpretation is consistent with Klarna's continued revenue growth even as its valuation declined, indicating that the business model remains viable but less profitable, and therefore less valuable, when funding costs are higher. This distinction between operational viability and valuation reflects the fundamental role of discount rates in asset pricing, where higher funding costs reduce the present value of future cash flows even when those cash flows continue to grow.

**Implications for Understanding BNPL Interest Rate Sensitivity:** Klarna's IPO experience provides several important insights for understanding BNPL firms' sensitivity to monetary policy. First, the valuation collapse demonstrates that interest rate changes affect BNPL firms not only through direct funding cost channels but also through capital market access and investor expectations, illustrating the multi-channel nature of monetary policy transmission. Second, the deposit funding model creates a different sensitivity profile that requires separate analysis from wholesale-funded BNPL firms, highlighting the importance of accounting for heterogeneity in funding structures when analyzing sector-wide patterns. Third, the timing of the IPO itself serves as a signal that interest rate environments fundamentally alter the conditions under which BNPL firms can access capital, demonstrating that monetary policy affects the sector through multiple channels beyond direct funding costs. These insights inform my empirical strategy by highlighting the importance of controlling for market-wide factors and understanding the mechanisms through which monetary policy affects BNPL firm performance.

These insights motivate my empirical analysis, which seeks to quantify the magnitude of BNPL firms' interest rate sensitivity using stock return data. While Klarna's IPO provides compelling narrative evidence of interest rate sensitivity, systematic econometric analysis across multiple BNPL firms and time periods is necessary to provide robust quantitative estimates of this relationship and to understand how different funding structures affect sensitivity patterns.

Several secondary questions guide the investigation and inform the empirical strategy. The first question addresses the magnitude of BNPL firms' interest rate sensitivity relative to the broader market. This examines whether BNPL firms represent a distinct asset class with different sensitivity compared to traditional financial stocks or the broader equity market. This question has important implications for portfolio construction and risk management, as it helps investors understand whether BNPL stocks require distinct risk assessment frameworks.

The second question explores the economic channels through which monetary policy affects BNPL firms. This specifically examines whether transmission occurs through funding costs, consumer demand, or credit conditions. Understanding these transmission mechanisms is crucial for both academic understanding of monetary policy transmission and policy formulation regarding financial stability and consumer protection.

The third question investigates how consumer spending patterns and credit market conditions mediate the relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns. Di Maggio, Williams, and Katz document that BNPL access increases total spending by $130 per week on average, with spending remaining elevated for 24 weeks after first use (Di Maggio et al.). This persistent spending effect, combined with evidence that BNPL usage is concentrated among consumers with moderate to high credit scores (680-740), indicates that consumer spending variables play a crucial mediating role in the relationship between monetary policy and BNPL returns. Understanding these mediating channels is essential for identifying the mechanisms through which monetary policy affects BNPL firm performance.

## 1.2 Research Contribution

This study contributes to three distinct strands of literature: fintech valuation, monetary policy transmission, and consumer credit markets. A detailed discussion of these contributions and the specific gaps in existing research that this study addresses is provided in Section 2.6 (Literature Review).

## 1.3 Methodology Overview

The study employs a multi-factor regression framework that extends beyond simple bivariate relationships to control for confounding factors and isolate BNPL-specific sensitivity to interest rates. The econometric specification addresses several identification challenges inherent in time series analysis of financial returns, including endogeneity concerns, omitted variable bias, and reverse causality. The framework draws on established methods in financial econometrics, adapting techniques developed for analyzing bank stock returns and monetary policy transmission to the unique characteristics of BNPL firms.

The analysis employs a two-stage modeling approach. The base model specification takes the following form:$$\log(BNPL\_Return_t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \Delta FFR_t + \varepsilon_t$$where $\log(BNPL\_Return_t)$ represents the log-transformed monthly BNPL stock return calculated as an equally-weighted portfolio of publicly-traded BNPL firms, calculated as $\log(1 + BNPL\_Return_t/100)$, and $\Delta FFR_t$ denotes the month-over-month change in the Federal Funds Rate.

The full specification model extends this framework by incorporating additional control variables:$$\log(BNPL\_Return_t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \Delta FFR_t + \beta_2 \Delta CC_t + \beta_3 \Delta DI_t + \beta_4 \Delta \pi_t + \beta_5 R_{Market,t} + \varepsilon_t$$where $\Delta CC_t$ captures month-over-month changes in the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, $\Delta DI_t$ represents month-over-month percentage changes in real disposable personal income, $\Delta \pi_t$ denotes month-over-month percentage changes in the Consumer Price Index (inflation), and $R_{Market,t}$ represents the monthly return on the S&P 500 index (SPY) as a proxy for systematic market risk.

The use of log-transformed returns facilitates elasticity interpretation of coefficients while addressing heteroskedasticity and distributional skewness common in financial return data. This transformation is standard in financial econometrics and allows coefficients to be interpreted as approximate percentage changes in returns per unit change in the independent variables. Estimation employs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) with robust standard errors using the Huber-White HC3 specification, which accounts for heteroskedasticity and potential outliers common in financial returns data. The choice of HC3 standard errors is particularly important given the relatively small sample size of 67 monthly observations. MacKinnon and White demonstrate that HC3 standard errors perform better than HC0 or HC1 specifications in small samples, providing more accurate inference in finite samples (MacKinnon and White). This methodological choice reflects careful attention to the statistical properties of our data and ensures robust inference despite the limited sample size.

The analysis conducts comprehensive model diagnostics including multicollinearity checks through correlation matrices, variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis, outlier detection using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, residual analysis, and heteroskedasticity tests. The study reports multiple model fit statistics including R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, F-statistic, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance and diagnostic validity.

Data collection draws from authoritative sources including the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API for macroeconomic indicators and Yahoo Finance for financial market data. The sample period spans February 2020 to August 2025, comprising 67 monthly observations that capture the rapid growth phase of the BNPL industry alongside dramatic monetary policy shifts from near-zero rates to approximately 5%.

This period provides substantial variation in the key explanatory variable (Federal Funds Rate), which is essential for estimating associations between interest rates and BNPL returns. The Federal Reserve's transition from accommodative monetary policy (near-zero rates) to restrictive policy (approximately 5%) over the sample period provides substantial variation that allows us to examine how BNPL stock returns are associated with dramatic shifts in funding costs. BNPL firms included in the analysis comprise Affirm Holdings (AFRM), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), and Sezzle (SEZL), selected based on criteria established in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Market Trends Report (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, "Buy Now, Pay Later"). These firms represent substantial market coverage, with PayPal's BNPL product (Pay in 4) representing 68.1% of US BNPL market share, making it the largest BNPL provider. Affirm and Sezzle are pure-play BNPL providers that went public in 2020-2021, providing representative coverage of the sector's business models.
