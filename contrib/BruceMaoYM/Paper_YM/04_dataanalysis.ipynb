    "## Data Analysis: Investigating BNPL Stock Returns and Monetary Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "This section examines whether BNPL stock returns respond to changes in monetary policy. The sector's rapid growth and reliance on funding markets motivate this analysis. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's 2025 report, BNPL adoption has grown substantially, with 21% of consumers with credit records utilizing BNPL services in 2022. The sector's reliance on short-term funding suggests that interest rate changes should affect BNPL firms' costs and profitability, which should be reflected in stock returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis proceeds in several steps. BNPL companies are identified through regulatory reports, financial data platforms, and industry analysis. Stock price data are collected from Yahoo Finance, and macroeconomic data are gathered from FRED. Variables are constructed and relationships examined through visual analysis and regression. Alternative analytical approaches assess robustness. Results are interpreted in the context of what they reveal about BNPL as a sector and how investors price these stocks."

    "### Identifying BNPL Companies: Research Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis begins by identifying publicly-traded BNPL companies. The {cite}`CFPB2022MarketTrends` provides the starting point, identifying major BNPL providers in the U.S. market. This report documents that PayPal's \"Pay in 4\" product represents 68.1% of U.S. BNPL market share. Searches of Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg Terminal (via university access), and SEC EDGAR filings identify which BNPL providers are publicly traded. This process reveals three firms with sufficient trading history: PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL), Affirm Holdings Inc. (AFRM), and Sezzle Inc. (SEZL). Industry reports from {cite}`DigitalSilk2025` and other fintech research sources supplement this identification process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional data sources were considered but not incorporated. Company earnings calls and investor presentations could provide qualitative evidence on funding costs and business model sensitivity, but were not incorporated into the quantitative analysis. Credit bureau data could provide insights into BNPL usage patterns, but access was limited. Direct transaction volume data would be ideal but is proprietary and unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final sample excludes other major BNPL providers that are not publicly traded (e.g., Klarna, Afterpay prior to acquisition, Zip) or that went public after the sample period ends (e.g., Klarna IPO in September 2025). The sample also excludes firms with insufficient trading history or data availability issues (e.g., Block/Square's BNPL operations are not separately traded). This limitation means results may not generalize to the broader BNPL sector, but the three firms included represent substantial market coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection: Tools and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Period: The analysis covers February 2020 to August 2025, comprising 67 monthly observations. This period captures the rapid growth phase of the BNPL industry alongside significant monetary policy shifts from near-zero rates to approximately 5%. The sample period includes four distinct monetary policy regimes: (1) emergency rate cuts to near-zero in March 2020, (2) prolonged zero-rate period through early 2022, (3) aggressive tightening cycle from March 2022 to July 2023 (525 basis points), and (4) rate pause and stabilization from July 2023 onward. This substantial variation in the key explanatory variable creates a natural experiment for examining how BNPL firms respond to rate changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stock price data are collected using Python's `yfinance` library, which provides free access to Yahoo Finance data. For each firm (PYPL, AFRM, SEZL), daily price data is downloaded from February 2020 to August 2025, then aggregated to monthly frequency by taking the last trading day's closing price of each month (month-end prices). This approach ensures accurate month-end prices while maintaining monthly frequency that aligns with macroeconomic variables. Monthly returns are then calculated as percentage changes between consecutive month-end prices. The `yfinance` library automatically handles stock splits and dividend adjustments, ensuring data quality. Yahoo Finance is chosen over alternatives (Bloomberg, CRSP, Compustat) because it is free and publicly available, provides reliable price data for publicly-traded stocks, offers Python integration that simplifies data collection and analysis, and provides complete coverage for all three firms throughout the sample period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Macroeconomic variables are collected from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) using Python's `fredapi` library. FRED provides free access to thousands of economic time series maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The following series are downloaded: Federal Funds Rate (FEDFUNDS), University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (UMCSENT), Real Disposable Personal Income (DSPIC96), and Consumer Price Index, Seasonally Adjusted (CPIAUCSLSA). FRED is the standard source for macroeconomic data in economic research because it is maintained by the Federal Reserve, ensuring data reliability; provides long historical series with consistent definitions; is available to all researchers, not just those with Bloomberg/Refinitiv access; and is well-documented with clear variable definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After collecting data, several quality checks are performed. Gaps in time series are checked (none found), extreme values are identified and verified to correspond to actual market events (e.g., March 2020 COVID crash), all variables are ensured to be measured at month-end dates, and transformations (first differences, percentage changes) are verified to produce expected patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BNPL Portfolio Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis includes three publicly-traded BNPL firms: PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL), Affirm Holdings Inc. (AFRM), and Sezzle Inc. (SEZL). These firms are selected based on the research process described above. Several important limitations affect this firm selection. The sample excludes other major BNPL providers that are not publicly traded (e.g., Klarna, Afterpay prior to acquisition, Zip) or that went public after the sample period ends (e.g., Klarna IPO in September 2025). The sample also excludes firms with insufficient trading history or data availability issues (e.g., Block/Square's BNPL operations are not separately traded). Additionally, the sample may suffer from survivorship bias, as only firms that survived and went public are included. These limitations mean results may not generalize to the broader BNPL sector, particularly smaller providers or those operating under different business models. However, the three firms included represent substantial market coverage: PayPal's BNPL product (Pay in 4) represents 68.1% of U.S. BNPL market share, making it the largest BNPL provider. Affirm and Sezzle are pure-play BNPL providers that went public in 2020-2021, providing representative coverage of the sector's business models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BNPL portfolio is constructed using equal weighting, where each firm receives equal weight regardless of market capitalization. This approach has both advantages and limitations. Equal weighting reduces the dominance of PayPal, which has substantially larger market capitalization than Affirm or Sezzle. This ensures that pure-play BNPL firms (Affirm, Sezzle) receive equal representation in the portfolio, capturing sector-wide patterns rather than being dominated by PayPal's diversified operations. Equal weighting also reduces the influence of market capitalization changes that may be unrelated to BNPL-specific factors. However, equal weighting creates a distorted representation of the sector's economic importance. PayPal's BNPL operations represent the majority of market share, yet receive only one-third weight in the portfolio. This may bias results if PayPal exhibits different sensitivity patterns than pure-play BNPL firms. Additionally, Sezzle's small market capitalization and limited liquidity may introduce noise into the portfolio return. As a robustness check, specifications excluding PayPal and excluding Sezzle are examined to assess sensitivity to portfolio construction choices. Alternative portfolio constructions, value-weighted portfolios, principal component analysis, or firm-level panel regressions, are discussed in robustness checks but not implemented due to sample size constraints. Detailed robustness analysis is provided in the robustness checks section.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each individual BNPL company, monthly returns are calculated as $R_{i,t} = \\frac{P_{i,t} - P_{i,t-1}}{P_{i,t-1}} \\times 100$ where $P_{i,t}$ is the month-end closing price for firm $i$ in month $t$. The portfolio return is then calculated as the equally-weighted average: $R_{t}^{BNPL} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} R_{i,t}$ where $N = 3$ (PYPL, AFRM, SEZL). The transformation $\\log(1 + R_{t}^{BNPL}/100)$ is applied to portfolio returns. Since returns are in percentage form (e.g., 5% = 5), dividing by 100 converts to decimal for the logarithm. The addition of 1 ensures the transformation works for negative returns. This transformation addresses distributional skewness, stabilizes variance, and facilitates elasticity interpretation. A detailed comparison of log-linear versus linear-log specifications is provided in the Functional Form Selection section.\n",

    "Notes: Correlations are calculated using monthly data from February 2020 to August 2025 (n = 67). The strong positive correlation between BNPL returns and market returns (r = 0.71) confirms that market movements dominate BNPL return variation. The weak correlation between BNPL returns and Federal Funds Rate changes (r = 0.15) provides preliminary evidence of rate independence. All correlations are below 0.80 in absolute value, indicating no severe multicollinearity concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monthly returns are constructed for each firm using month-end closing prices from Yahoo Finance. The portfolio return is calculated as an equally-weighted average of the three firms' returns. A log transformation is applied to address right-skewness in return distributions and to facilitate elasticity interpretation. The mean return of 0.85% per month (approximately 10.2% annualized) reflects the sample period's mixed performance, while the standard deviation of 12.34% indicates substantial volatility. This high volatility means that even economically meaningful relationships may fail to achieve statistical significance, which helps explain why the interest rate coefficient is economically large but statistically insignificant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Month-over-month changes are calculated by taking first differences of the effective Federal Funds Rate from FRED. The mean change of 0.02 percentage points reflects the gradual nature of monetary policy adjustments, while the standard deviation of 0.18 percentage points captures periods of rapid policy shifts (notably 2022-2023). The range from -0.50 to +0.75 percentage points reflects the Federal Reserve's most aggressive tightening cycle since the 1980s. The preponderance of zero observations (rate unchanged for multiple months) creates measurement challenges but aligns with how monetary policy actually operates. This low-frequency variation reduces statistical power to detect relationships, which may explain why the interest rate coefficient fails to achieve statistical significance despite its economic magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Month-over-month changes in the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index capture shifts in forward-looking consumer expectations. The mean change of -0.15 points reflects overall sentiment decline during the sample period (driven by pandemic uncertainty and inflation concerns), while the large standard deviation (4.82 points) captures substantial month-to-month volatility in consumer sentiment. The index ranges from 50 to 150, with changes reflecting shifts in consumer spending intentions that directly affect BNPL transaction volume. This volatility in consumer sentiment creates substantial variation that should help identify relationships, yet the consumer confidence coefficient approaches but does not achieve statistical significance, suggesting that market returns may capture much of the systematic variation in consumer sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Month-over-month changes are calculated percentage changes in real (inflation-adjusted) disposable personal income from FRED. The mean growth rate of 0.18% per month (approximately 2.2% annualized) reflects moderate income growth during the sample period, while the standard deviation of 0.78% captures substantial variation including pandemic-related income shocks. Negative values (minimum -2.10%) reflect periods of income decline, while positive values capture income recovery and growth phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Month-over-month percentage changes in the seasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index capture inflation shocks affecting consumer purchasing power. The mean change of 0.42% per month (approximately 5.0% annualized) reflects elevated inflation during much of the sample period, while the standard deviation of 0.58% captures substantial variation from near-zero inflation (2020) to peak inflation (mid-2022). The range from -0.80% to +1.60% reflects deflationary and hyperinflationary episodes within the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monthly returns on the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) proxy for systematic market risk. The mean return of 0.89% per month (approximately 10.7% annualized) reflects overall market performance during the sample period, while the standard deviation of 4.52% indicates substantial market volatility. The range from -12.35% to +9.25% captures major market movements including pandemic-related crashes and recovery rallies. The fact that market returns explain 51% of BNPL return variation (R² = 0.51) indicates that systematic market factors dominate BNPL stock performance, potentially obscuring the relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis uses month-over-month changes in the Federal Funds Rate ($\\Delta FFR_t$) rather than levels. This choice addresses several concerns. Interest rate levels may be non-stationary, while changes are typically stationary. Changes capture policy shifts more directly than levels, which may reflect long-term trends unrelated to current policy. Changes also align with the theoretical mechanism: BNPL firms respond to funding cost changes, not absolute rate levels. However, using monthly changes creates measurement challenges. The Federal Funds Rate changes infrequently (often remaining constant for multiple months), creating many zero observations. This low-frequency variation may create attenuation bias and reduce statistical power. Alternative specifications using 2-year Treasury yield changes address this concern by providing higher-frequency variation (see robustness checks section for detailed results).\n",
    "\n",
    "Macroeconomic variables are measured contemporaneously with BNPL returns, creating potential simultaneity concerns. Macro data is typically released during the month (e.g., CPI released mid-month), while stock returns reflect information available throughout the month. This timing mismatch may bias estimates if macro data releases affect stock prices within the same month. Ideally, lagged macro variables would be used (e.g., $\\Delta CC_{t-1}$, $\\Delta DI_{t-1}$) to ensure that macro conditions are known before stock returns are realized. However, using contemporaneous variables captures the forward-looking nature of stock prices, which incorporate expectations about future macro conditions. As a robustness check, specifications with lagged macro variables are examined (see robustness checks section for detailed results), though results are not substantially different.\n",
    "\n",
    "The S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (SPY) is used as a proxy for broad market returns. The S&P 500 represents approximately 80% of U.S. equity market capitalization and provides a comprehensive benchmark for systematic market risk. Monthly returns are calculated as percentage changes in month-end closing prices, ensuring temporal alignment with BNPL stock returns. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (UMCSENT) is employed as a measure of forward-looking consumer spending intentions. This index captures consumers' expectations about future economic conditions and their own financial situation, which should directly affect BNPL usage as consumers make purchasing decisions. Month-over-month changes are calculated to capture shifts in consumer sentiment that may affect BNPL transaction volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real disposable personal income (DSPIC96) from FRED is used, which measures inflation-adjusted personal income after taxes. This variable captures the income channel through which economic conditions affect consumer purchasing power and BNPL usage. Pct changes (month-over-month) are calculated to measure growth in disposable income, which is more economically meaningful than levels for analyzing the relationship with stock returns. The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Seasonally Adjusted (CPIAUCSLSA) is employed as a measure of inflation. The seasonally adjusted series is used to remove predictable seasonal patterns (such as holiday shopping effects) that could confound this analysis. Seasonal adjustment is important for CPI because consumer prices can exhibit regular seasonal fluctuations that are unrelated to underlying inflation trends. Month-over-month percentage changes are calculated to capture inflation shocks that may affect consumer purchasing power and spending patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following variables are used with their seasonal adjustment status. Real Disposable Personal Income (DSPIC96) is obtained from FRED in seasonally adjusted form by default. This series removes seasonal patterns related to tax refunds, bonus payments, and other predictable income fluctuations. The Consumer Price Index (CPIAUCSLSA) uses the seasonally adjusted version rather than the non-seasonally adjusted version. Seasonal adjustment removes predictable patterns such as holiday shopping effects, seasonal food price variations, and energy price fluctuations related to weather patterns. Consumer Sentiment (UMCSENT) is a survey-based index that does not require seasonal adjustment, as it measures consumer expectations rather than actual economic activity that might exhibit seasonal patterns. The Federal Funds Rate (FEDFUNDS) does not exhibit predictable seasonal patterns and therefore does not require seasonal adjustment. Stock returns are already in first-difference form (monthly changes) and do not require seasonal adjustment. While stock markets may exhibit some calendar effects (such as the January effect), these are not predictable seasonal patterns in the same sense as economic time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample period spans from February 2020 to August 2025, providing 67 monthly observations. This period encompasses several important macroeconomic events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, monetary policy tightening in 2022-2023, and subsequent policy normalization, providing substantial variation in both dependent and independent variables. All variables are aligned to monthly frequency and synchronized to month-end dates to ensure temporal consistency. Stock prices are measured at month-end closing prices, and macroeconomic variables are aligned to the same month-end dates. This synchronization ensures that all variables reflect conditions during the same time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing data are handled using inner joins when merging variables from different sources. This approach retains only observations where all variables have complete data, ensuring a balanced panel dataset. After merging, an additional dropna() operation is applied to remove any remaining missing values. This conservative approach ensures that the final sample consists of 67 complete observations with no missing data across any variable. No observations were excluded due to missing data, indicating complete data availability across all variables for the sample period. All variables exhibit complete coverage for the sample period. Stock return data from Yahoo Finance provides continuous coverage for all three BNPL firms throughout the period. Macroeconomic data from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) provides complete monthly series for all variables. The final dataset contains no missing values, ensuring that all 67 observations are used in regression estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interest Rate Variable Selection: Theoretical and Empirical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The selection of an appropriate interest rate variable requires balancing theoretical relevance with empirical considerations. While multiple interest rate measures could potentially capture BNPL firms' funding costs, the analysis focuses on the Federal Funds Rate for several reasons. First, BNPL firms rely heavily on short-term funding markets, including warehouse credit facilities, securitization markets, and commercial paper markets, all of which are directly influenced by the Federal Funds Rate. Second, the Federal Funds Rate serves as the primary monetary policy instrument, making it the most policy-relevant measure for understanding how monetary policy affects BNPL stock returns. Third, data availability and reliability favor the Federal Funds Rate, which is published daily by the Federal Reserve and has a long historical record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative interest rate measures, such as commercial paper rates or credit spreads, could theoretically provide more direct measures of BNPL firms' actual funding costs. However, these alternatives face data availability constraints and are highly correlated with the Federal Funds Rate, making the incremental benefit of using alternative measures limited. The Federal Funds Rate provides a clean, policy-relevant measure that captures the primary channel through which monetary policy affects BNPL firms' cost of capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Specification: Theoretical Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The econometric models are motivated by theoretical considerations regarding the determinants of equity returns in general and BNPL stock returns in particular. The base model focuses on interest rate sensitivity, motivated by the sector's reliance on short-term funding markets documented by the {cite}`CFPB2025ConsumerUse`. The full specification model extends this framework by incorporating additional economic channels that theory suggests should affect BNPL stock performance: consumer spending patterns (captured by consumer confidence and disposable income), purchasing power effects (captured by inflation), and systematic market risk (captured by market returns).\n",
    "\n",
    "Base Model Specification:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log(1 + BNPL\\_Return_t/100) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(\\Delta Federal\\_Funds\\_Rate_t) + \\varepsilon_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where BNPL_Return_t is the monthly return in percentage terms. The transformation log(1 + BNPL_Return_t/100) addresses distributional skewness, truncation at -100%, and approximates continuously compounded returns. This specification tests the hypothesis that BNPL stock returns are associated with changes in short-term interest rates, which would be expected given BNPL firms' reliance on funding markets. The coefficient $\\beta_1$ measures the elasticity of BNPL returns with respect to Federal Funds Rate changes, with a negative coefficient expected if higher interest rates increase funding costs and reduce profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full Specification Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log(1 + BNPL\\_Return_t/100) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(\\Delta Federal\\_Funds\\_Rate_t) + \\beta_2(\\Delta Consumer\\_Confidence_t) + \\beta_3(\\Delta Disposable\\_Income_t) + \\beta_4(\\Delta Inflation_t) + \\beta_5(Market\\_Return_t) + \\varepsilon_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This specification extends the base model by incorporating control variables that capture additional economic channels affecting BNPL stock returns. The inclusion of these variables serves multiple purposes: (1) controlling for factors that may be correlated with interest rates, providing a more accurate estimate of the direct interest rate effect; (2) capturing additional economic mechanisms that theory suggests should affect BNPL performance; and (3) improving model fit and reducing omitted variable bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical justification for each control variable stems from understanding how BNPL firms generate revenue and face costs. Consumer confidence affects forward-looking spending intentions, directly influencing BNPL transaction volume. Disposable income affects consumers' ability to make purchases and use BNPL services. Inflation affects purchasing power and may influence consumer spending patterns. Market returns capture systematic market risk, isolating BNPL-specific effects from general market movements. Together, these variables provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the multiple economic channels affecting BNPL stock performance.\n"

    "Chart A displays the time series of log-transformed BNPL stock returns from February 2020 to August 2025. The time series reveals substantial volatility throughout the sample period, with notable episodes of both positive and negative performance. The high volatility, particularly during 2021, reflects BNPL's nature as an emerging sector driven by technological adoption and regulatory uncertainty rather than macroeconomic fundamentals. This volatility pattern corresponds to distinct macroeconomic and sector-specific events: the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 coincided with significant negative returns, reflecting initial market uncertainty regarding BNPL firms' ability to weather economic disruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The period of strong positive returns in late 2020 and 2021 reflects the rapid growth in BNPL adoption documented by the {cite}`CFPB2025ConsumerUse`, as consumers turned to alternative payment methods during the pandemic. This period saw increased transaction volume and revenue growth for BNPL providers, as consumers shifted purchasing behavior toward e-commerce and sought flexible payment options during a period of economic uncertainty. The sharp negative returns observed in mid-2022 align with rising interest rates and increased funding costs, consistent with the {cite}`CFPB2022MarketTrends` documentation that BNPL firms' cost of funds increased substantially during this period. Higher interest rates compressed profit margins and reduced investor confidence, as the sector's thin margins (provider revenues represent only about 4% of gross merchandise volume according to {cite}`DigitalSilk2025`) made firms particularly vulnerable to funding cost increases.\n",

The negative slope of the regression line (estimated coefficient of -12.51) is visible, but the wide confidence interval reflects substantial uncertainty around this estimate. The regression results indicate a negative relationship between interest rate changes and log BNPL returns, with a point estimate of -12.51 (p-value = 0.2202), but this relationship is not statistically significant at conventional levels. The R² of 0.022 indicates that interest rate changes alone explain only 2.2% of the variation in log BNPL returns, and the 95% confidence interval [-32.69, 7.67] includes zero. The substantial dispersion around the regression line provides empirical motivation for the full specification model, which incorporates additional control variables to capture other economic channels and improve the model's explanatory power.\n",

    "\n",
    "The analysis uses log-transformed BNPL returns as the dependent variable with linear independent variables. This log-linear specification is chosen because: (1) coefficients represent elasticities (percentage change in returns per unit change in independent variables), which is intuitive for financial returns; (2) log transformation addresses heteroskedasticity and normalizes right-skewed return distributions; and (3) log-linear specifications are standard in financial econometrics. For example, $\\beta_1 = -12.68$ means a one percentage point increase in Federal Funds Rate changes is associated with approximately a 12.68% decrease in BNPL returns."

    "## Regression Analysis: Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimation Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative specifications use regression analysis to estimate the relationship between BNPL returns and interest rate changes. Two models are estimated: a base model with only interest rates, and a full model that adds control variables (consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation, market returns). Alternative specifications use Python's `statsmodels` library to estimate these models using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) with robust standard errors to account for potential heteroskedasticity in financial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale for regression: Regression allows the analysis to control for multiple factors simultaneously, isolating the relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns while accounting for other economic conditions that might affect both variables. This helps address the concern that interest rate changes might be correlated with other economic conditions that also affect BNPL returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "What Regression Can Do: Regression identifies associations between variables, controlling for other factors. In this case, it indicates how BNPL returns move with interest rates after accounting for market movements, consumer confidence, disposable income, and inflation. This provides evidence on whether BNPL stocks exhibit sensitivity patterns consistent with theoretical predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Regression Cannot Do: Regression cannot establish causality from observational data alone. Interest rate changes are not random experiments, they respond to economic conditions that also affect BNPL returns. This means the estimates capture associations rather than causal effects. However, this descriptive evidence is still valuable for understanding how BNPL stocks behave relative to monetary policy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Confounding Factors: Several factors might affect both interest rates and BNPL returns simultaneously, making it difficult to isolate the direct effect of interest rates. Economic conditions represent one such factor: when the Fed raises rates in response to inflation, both the rate increase and the underlying inflation may affect BNPL returns. The analysis controls for inflation to address this. Regulatory changes represent another potential confound: the CFPB's May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit cards occurred during a period of rising interest rates. If this affected stock prices independently, it could confound the estimates. Market sentiment may also confound the relationship: interest rate changes may affect broader market sentiment, which also affects BNPL returns. The analysis controls for market returns to address this. Finally, competitive dynamics may play a role: BNPL firms may face different competitive pressures during periods when rates are changing, affecting returns independently of funding costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "How the analysis addresses these concerns: The analysis includes control variables (market returns, consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation) to account for factors that might confound the interest rate relationship. However, the analysis cannot fully eliminate all potential confounding factors, so the results should be interpreted as associations rather than causal effects. This is a standard limitation of observational studies, but the descriptive evidence is still valuable for understanding how BNPL stocks behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Constraints and Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis operates under several constraints. The limited sample size (67 monthly observations) reduces statistical power, reflecting the recent emergence of publicly-traded BNPL firms. The use of Federal Funds Rate changes rather than exogenous monetary policy shocks means estimates capture associations rather than causal effects. The portfolio approach masks firm-level heterogeneity. Results are interpreted as associations rather than causal effects. Additional discussion of limitations and future research directions is provided in the Limitations and Future Research section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Power Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "With 67 observations and 5 predictors in the full model, the analysis has approximately 80% power to detect correlations |r| > 0.30 and 90% power to detect correlations |r| > 0.35. The observed correlation between Federal Funds Rate changes and BNPL returns is r ≈ 0.15 (based on R² = 0.022), which falls below these detectability thresholds. Post-hoc power analysis for the observed effect size ($\\beta_1 = -12.68SE = 9.95) yields power of approximately 15-20%, indicating limited ability to detect relationships even if they exist. However, the economic magnitude of the coefficient (-12.68) combined with the low R² (0.022) suggests that even if a relationship exists, it is economically small relative to other factors driving BNPL returns. The fact that market returns explain 51% of variation while interest rates explain only 2.2% indicates that interest rate sensitivity, if present, is dominated by other factors. This power analysis suggests that the null finding may reflect both limited statistical power and genuine economic independence, with the latter being the more likely explanation given the dominance of market factors in explaining BNPL return variation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) tests whether regressors are collinear, which would inflate standard errors and make coefficients unstable. All VIF values below 1.3 indicate no multicollinearity concern, suggesting that the independent variables are sufficiently independent to allow reliable coefficient estimation. The Breusch-Pagan test checks whether error variance is constant across observations (homoskedasticity). A p-value of 0.135 means the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity cannot be rejected at conventional levels, though HC3 robust standard errors are employed as a precaution against potential heteroskedasticity in financial return data. The Durbin-Watson statistic tests for first-order autocorrelation in residuals, which would violate the independence assumption underlying OLS regression. A value of 1.87, close to the ideal value of 2.0, indicates no autocorrelation, suggesting that residuals are independent across time periods. The Jarque-Bera test checks whether residuals are normally distributed, which affects the validity of t-tests and confidence intervals. A p-value of 0.198 means the null hypothesis of normality cannot be rejected, indicating that the residuals are approximately normally distributed and that standard statistical inference procedures are appropriate. Together, these diagnostic tests provide evidence that the model satisfies the key assumptions underlying OLS regression, supporting the validity of the coefficient estimates and hypothesis tests."

    "The main empirical finding is that BNPL stock returns exhibit a negative but statistically insignificant relationship with Federal Funds Rate changes ($\\beta_1 = -12.68$, SE = 9.95, p = 0.202). The point estimate suggests economically meaningful sensitivity—a one percentage point increase in the Federal Funds Rate is associated with approximately 12.7% lower log returns—but high volatility of BNPL returns (monthly standard deviation of 12.34%) and limited statistical power prevent precise estimation. Despite theoretical predictions and firm-level evidence suggesting BNPL firms should be sensitive to interest rate changes, monthly stock return data do not provide statistically significant evidence of this relationship after controlling for market movements and macroeconomic factors.\n",

Despite the smaller sample, Model 3 achieves higher R² (0.617) but the interest rate coefficient remains statistically insignificant (p = 0.423).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Coefficient Interpretation: Full Model (Model 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "The full model specification provides the most comprehensive estimate of BNPL stock return sensitivity, controlling for market movements, consumer confidence, disposable income, and inflation. The following interpretations apply to Model 2, which includes all control variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interest rate coefficient ($\\beta_1 = -12.68$, p = 0.202) indicates that a one percentage point increase in the month-over-month change in the Federal Funds Rate is associated with approximately 12.7% lower log returns on BNPL stocks. This coefficient is economically large—comparable in magnitude to the inflation coefficient—but statistically insignificant at conventional levels. The 95% confidence interval [-32.18, 6.81] includes zero, indicating substantial uncertainty around the point estimate. The wide confidence interval reflects both the high volatility of BNPL returns and the limited sample size (67 monthly observations). The negative sign aligns with theoretical predictions: higher interest rates increase BNPL firms' funding costs, compressing profit margins and reducing profitability, which should be reflected in negative stock returns. However, the statistical insignificance suggests that either the true effect is smaller than the point estimate, the effect operates through channels not captured in monthly data, or other factors dominate return variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The market return coefficient ($\\beta_5 = 2.38$, p < 0.001) indicates that BNPL stocks move 2.38% for every 1% move in the S&P 500. This high market beta is statistically significant and economically large, explaining most of the systematic variation in BNPL returns. The beta of 2.38 indicates that BNPL stocks are \"risk-on\" assets that amplify market movements, behaving more like growth-oriented technology stocks than rate-sensitive financial institutions. During a 10% market decline, BNPL stocks would be expected to decline by approximately 24%, making them highly sensitive to changes in risk sentiment and growth expectations. This finding suggests investors price BNPL stocks based on market-wide sentiment and growth prospects rather than sector-specific fundamentals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inflation coefficient ($\\beta_4 = -12.94$, p = 0.049) is statistically significant and negative, indicating that a one percentage point increase in month-over-month inflation is associated with approximately 12.9% lower log returns. This relationship likely operates through multiple channels: inflation erodes consumer purchasing power, reducing discretionary spending and BNPL transaction volume; inflation increases funding costs through its effect on nominal interest rates; and inflation creates economic uncertainty that affects consumer confidence and credit demand. The statistical significance of the inflation coefficient, combined with the insignificance of the interest rate coefficient, suggests that inflation may affect BNPL firms through channels beyond direct funding cost pass-through.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consumer confidence coefficient ($\\beta_2 = 0.15$, p = 0.75) is positive but statistically insignificant. The point estimate suggests that a one-unit increase in the month-over-month change in consumer sentiment is associated with 0.15% higher log returns, but the large standard error and high p-value indicate substantial uncertainty. The lack of significance may reflect the dominance of market returns in capturing systematic variation, or it may indicate that consumer confidence affects BNPL returns through indirect channels (such as market sentiment) rather than directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disposable income coefficient ($\\beta_3 = -0.18$, p = 0.82) is negative but statistically insignificant. The point estimate suggests that a one percentage point increase in month-over-month disposable income growth is associated with 0.18% lower log returns, which is counterintuitive but not statistically distinguishable from zero. The lack of significance may reflect measurement issues, the dominance of market returns, or the possibility that disposable income affects BNPL returns through channels not captured in monthly data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full model achieves R² = 0.510 and adjusted R² = 0.470, indicating that the included variables explain approximately 51% of the variation in log BNPL returns. This represents a substantial improvement over the base model (R² = 0.022), demonstrating the importance of controlling for market movements and macroeconomic factors. The F-statistic for the full model is 12.8 (p < 0.001), indicating that the model as a whole is statistically significant. The adjusted R² of 0.470 accounts for the penalty for including five regressors, suggesting that the model provides meaningful explanatory power even after adjusting for degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Economic Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The regression results reveal several important patterns. First, market returns dominate BNPL return variation, with a beta of 2.38 indicating that BNPL stocks behave like growth-oriented technology companies rather than rate-sensitive financial institutions. Second, inflation exhibits statistically significant negative effects, suggesting that inflation shocks reduce BNPL returns through multiple channels. Third, interest rates show economically large but statistically insignificant negative effects, consistent with theoretical predictions but subject to substantial estimation uncertainty. Fourth, consumer confidence and disposable income show no statistically significant effects, though their signs align with theoretical expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The divergence between the economic magnitude of the interest rate coefficient (-12.68) and its statistical insignificance (p = 0.202) suggests that interest rates may matter for BNPL firms, but their effects are obscured by other factors or operate through channels that don't manifest in monthly return data. The high market beta (2.38) indicates that BNPL stock prices are driven primarily by market sentiment and risk appetite rather than sector-specific fundamentals, which may explain why interest rate sensitivity doesn't show up clearly in monthly returns.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Addressing the OLS vs IV Discrepancy\n",
    "\n",
    "The substantial difference between OLS ($\\beta_1$ = -12.68, p = 0.202) and IV ($\\beta_1$ = -37.07, p = 0.002) estimates raises important methodological questions. This threefold difference suggests several possible explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Federal Funds Rate changes are measured with error, OLS estimates will be biased toward zero (attenuation bias). The IV approach, by using lagged rates as instruments, may partially address this by exploiting variation in lagged rates that is less subject to measurement error. However, this explanation is limited because Federal Funds Rate data from FRED is highly accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IV estimate assumes that lagged rates affect BNPL returns only through their effect on current rates (exclusion restriction). However, lagged rates may affect BNPL returns through other channels: lagged rates may predict future economic conditions that directly affect BNPL demand, lagged rates may affect investor expectations about future monetary policy, or lagged rates may be correlated with unobserved time-varying factors. If these channels exist, the IV exclusion restriction is violated, and the IV estimate may be biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IV model includes only the interest rate variable, while the OLS full model includes market returns, consumer confidence, disposable income, and inflation. The lower R² of the IV model (0.093 vs 0.510) suggests that omitting these controls may affect the coefficient estimate. However, the IV estimate remains substantially larger even when compared to the base OLS model (-12.51), suggesting specification differences alone cannot explain the discrepancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IV approach may be capturing effects from a different time period or different rate environment than the OLS estimates. If the relationship between rates and BNPL returns varies over time, the IV estimate (which relies on lagged rates) may reflect a different period's sensitivity pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the primary research question—describing the relationship between Federal Funds Rate changes and BNPL stock returns—the OLS full model estimate ($\\beta_1$ = -12.68, p = 0.202) is more credible because it includes comprehensive controls that address omitted variable bias, it uses the full sample and all available information, it does not rely on the exclusion restriction assumption (which is questionable for lagged rates), and it provides the highest explanatory power (R² = 0.510).\n",
    "\n",
    "The IV estimate provides evidence that a relationship exists under specific identifying assumptions, but the violation of the exclusion restriction (lagged rates likely affect BNPL returns through channels other than current rates) limits its credibility for causal interpretation. The IV result suggests that OLS may underestimate the true relationship, but the magnitude of the IV estimate should be interpreted cautiously given the assumption violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OLS estimate of -12.68 (p = 0.202) represents the best descriptive evidence of the relationship between interest rate changes and BNPL returns, while acknowledging that statistical power limitations prevent precise estimation. The IV result provides complementary evidence that a relationship exists, but its magnitude should not be taken as the definitive estimate given assumption violations.\n"

    "## Discussion: Interpretation and Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "The main finding, that BNPL stock returns do not show a statistically significant relationship with interest rate changes, is itself an important economic result. This section discusses the implications for understanding BNPL as a sector, how investors price these stocks, and the broader implications for understanding consumer credit markets and financial innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BNPL as an Asset Class: Growth Stocks or Financial Stocks\n",
    "\n",
    "BNPL stocks exhibit pricing behavior that differs substantially from traditional financial stocks. Banks and credit card companies demonstrate clear sensitivity to interest rate changes because their business models depend directly on net interest margins, the spread between lending rates and funding costs. When rates rise, banks' funding costs increase, but they can pass these costs to borrowers through higher lending rates, maintaining margins. BNPL firms operate under a fundamentally different revenue model, generating income primarily through merchant fees and late payment fees rather than interest rate spreads. This structural difference suggests that BNPL firms should exhibit different sensitivity patterns, and the empirical evidence indicates that investors recognize this difference and price BNPL stocks accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The finding that market returns explain substantially more of BNPL return variation (R² = 0.51 in the full model) than interest rate changes indicates that investors treat BNPL stocks as part of the broader equity market rather than as a distinct rate-sensitive sector. This pattern is consistent with viewing BNPL firms as technology-enabled companies that provide credit services, rather than as credit companies that happen to use technology. The high market beta ($\\beta =$ 2.38) further supports this interpretation, BNPL stocks behave like growth-oriented technology stocks, amplifying market movements rather than responding primarily to interest rate changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors are pricing BNPL stocks based on growth expectations, competitive dynamics, and market sentiment rather than on funding cost sensitivity. This pricing behavior reflects the sector's status as a growth industry where future prospects matter more than current profitability. The fact that interest rate sensitivity doesn't show up in stock returns suggests that investors may not perceive funding costs as a major risk factor, other factors dominate return variation, or the sensitivity operates through indirect channels that don't manifest in monthly return data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determinants of BNPL Stock Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that BNPL stocks do not respond significantly to interest rates in monthly data, the evidence suggests that growth expectations, competitive dynamics, and market sentiment play dominant roles in driving returns. As a relatively young sector, BNPL firms face investor focus on market share expansion, customer acquisition costs, and regulatory developments rather than short-term funding cost fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The market return coefficient ($\\beta =$ 2.38) dominates the model, explaining most of the systematic variation in BNPL returns. This high beta indicates that BNPL stocks are \"risk-on\" assets that investors buy during optimistic periods and sell during pessimistic periods. The beta of 2.38 means that BNPL stocks move 2.38% for every 1% move in the market, making them highly sensitive to changes in risk sentiment and growth expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inflation coefficient ($\\beta =$ -12.94, p-value = 0.049) is statistically significant and negative, indicating that inflation shocks reduce BNPL returns. This relationship likely operates through multiple channels: inflation erodes consumer purchasing power, reducing discretionary spending and BNPL transaction volume; inflation increases funding costs through its effect on nominal interest rates; and inflation creates economic uncertainty that affects consumer confidence and credit demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consumer confidence and disposable income coefficients are not statistically significant, but their signs (positive for consumer confidence, negative for disposable income) align with theoretical expectations. The lack of significance may reflect the dominance of market returns in capturing systematic variation, or it may indicate that these variables affect BNPL returns through indirect channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interest rate coefficient is economically large (-12.68) but statistically insignificant (p-value = 0.202). This pattern suggests that interest rates may matter for BNPL firms, but their effects are obscured by other factors or operate through channels that don't manifest in monthly return data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Divergence Between Funding Costs and Stock Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "A notable pattern emerges: firm-level evidence shows that BNPL firms' funding costs increased substantially as interest rates rose, yet stock returns don't show significant sensitivity. Several mechanisms may explain this divergence:\n",
    "\n",
    "Several mechanisms may explain this divergence. Investors may focus on growth metrics and competitive dynamics rather than funding costs when pricing BNPL stocks. The effects of funding costs may be small relative to market movements and other factors. Investors may have already anticipated rate changes and incorporated them into prices. Alternatively, the relationship may be nonlinear or take longer to materialize than monthly data can capture. BNPL stocks are priced like growth stocks, where long-term growth prospects matter more than short-term cost factors. This is consistent with how technology stocks are typically valued, focusing on market share and future potential rather than current profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications for Investors, Regulators, and Policymakers\n",
    "\n",
    "BNPL stocks have a high market beta (2.38), meaning they amplify market movements. During a 10% market decline, BNPL stocks would be expected to decline by about 24%. This makes them risky during downturns but potentially rewarding during bull markets. The lack of interest rate sensitivity suggests investors should focus on market sentiment, competitive dynamics, and regulatory developments rather than trying to time monetary policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The finding that stock returns don't respond significantly to interest rates doesn't mean funding costs don't affect BNPL firms' operations. Firm-level evidence shows funding costs increased substantially as rates rose. This divergence between firm-level profitability and stock-level returns raises questions about how investors price these stocks. Regulators should monitor BNPL firms' funding structures and interest rate risk exposure, particularly given their role in serving subprime consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "BNPL firms may represent a distinct channel of monetary policy transmission that operates differently from traditional financial intermediaries. While stock returns don't show significant sensitivity, firm-level evidence suggests funding costs do affect operations. Monetary policy may affect BNPL firms indirectly through market sentiment and risk appetite, or through inflation channels rather than interest rate channels directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Economic Interpretation: Mechanisms Underlying Rate Insensitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "The null result, finding no statistically significant relationship between interest rates and BNPL stock returns, is itself an important economic finding. It challenges conventional wisdom about how credit markets respond to monetary policy and suggests that BNPL operates through different mechanisms than traditional lending. This section explores the economic reasons why BNPL might exhibit this pattern and what it tells us about consumer credit markets and financial innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional credit providers (banks, credit card companies) exhibit clear interest rate sensitivity because their business models depend on interest rate spreads. When rates rise, banks can pass costs to borrowers, but BNPL firms operate differently. They generate revenue primarily through merchant fees (typically 2-6% of transaction value) and late payment fees, not interest rate spreads. This structural difference suggests that BNPL firms may be less sensitive to funding cost changes than traditional lenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "The finding that BNPL stocks don't respond significantly to interest rates suggests that the sector represents a new form of consumer credit that operates outside traditional monetary policy transmission channels. This has implications for understanding how financial innovation affects monetary policy effectiveness and how new business models may require different regulatory frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "BNPL represents a form of financial innovation that decouples credit provision from traditional banking models. By partnering with merchants rather than competing directly with credit cards, BNPL firms have created a business model that may be less sensitive to monetary policy. This suggests that financial innovation can create new transmission channels (or lack thereof) that policymakers need to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The divergence between firm-level evidence (showing funding cost sensitivity) and stock-level evidence (showing no significant return sensitivity) raises fundamental questions about asset pricing and market efficiency. Several economic mechanisms may explain this pattern. BNPL stocks may be valued using a growth stock model where future growth prospects dominate current profitability. In this framework, investors focus on market share expansion, customer acquisition, and long-term growth potential rather than short-term cost factors. Funding costs may affect profitability, but if investors believe that BNPL firms can grow their way out of cost pressures, stock prices may not respond to funding cost changes. The high market beta (2.38) suggests that BNPL stock prices are driven primarily by market sentiment and risk appetite rather than fundamental analysis. During periods of high risk appetite, growth stocks (including BNPL) rise regardless of funding costs. During periods of low risk appetite, growth stocks fall regardless of fundamentals. This sentiment-driven pricing may obscure the relationship between funding costs and stock returns. Stock prices reflect expectations about future profitability, not just current conditions. If investors anticipated interest rate increases and incorporated them into prices before they materialized, monthly rate changes may not show up in monthly returns. The fact that BNPL stock prices declined substantially during 2022-2023 (when rates rose) suggests that investors did incorporate rate expectations, but this incorporation may have occurred gradually rather than month-by-month. The relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns may be nonlinear or time-varying. BNPL firms may exhibit sensitivity only when rates cross certain thresholds (e.g., above 3% or 4%), or sensitivity patterns may have changed as the sector matured. The linear specification cannot capture such patterns, potentially obscuring relationships that exist but are not constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interest rates may affect BNPL firms through indirect channels that don't manifest in monthly return data. Higher rates may reduce consumer spending (affecting BNPL transaction volume), increase credit card competition (making BNPL less attractive), or affect investor risk appetite (reducing demand for growth stocks). These indirect effects may take months or quarters to materialize, requiring longer horizons to detect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Limitations and Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis provides descriptive evidence on BNPL stock returns' relationship with monetary policy. The following limitations affect interpretation: data availability constraints and methodological choices that reflect the challenges of analyzing a relatively new sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The limited sample size (67 monthly observations) reflects the recent emergence of publicly-traded BNPL firms. This constraint reduces statistical power, meaning economically meaningful relationships may not achieve statistical significance. Future research using higher-frequency data (weekly or daily) or longer time horizons would improve statistical power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative specifications use Federal Funds Rate changes rather than exogenous monetary policy shocks identified through high-frequency event studies. This means the estimates capture associations rather than causal effects. Future research using event studies around FOMC announcements could provide cleaner identification of causal relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equally-weighted portfolio approach masks firm-level heterogeneity. Individual BNPL firms may exhibit different sensitivity patterns based on size, funding structure, or business model. Future research using firm-level panel data could examine this heterogeneity more directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future research could explore several directions to build on this analysis. Examining whether BNPL firms' actual financial performance (revenue, margins, credit losses) responds to interest rates, independent of stock price movements, would provide complementary evidence to stock return analysis. Using high-frequency data around FOMC announcements could identify causal effects of monetary policy shocks. Exploring nonlinear specifications, threshold models, or time-varying coefficient models could capture relationships that may not be constant across rate levels or time periods. Including private BNPL firms, international firms, or fintech sector controls could assess generalizability beyond publicly-traded U.S. firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations do not invalidate the descriptive evidence provided by this analysis, but they highlight opportunities for future research to build a more complete understanding of how monetary policy affects BNPL firms and the broader fintech sector.\n",
