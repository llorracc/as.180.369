## Abstract

Affirm Holdings' funding costs increased 394% from fiscal year 2022 to 2024 as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates from near-zero to 5.25%. Despite this operational exposure, we find no statistically significant relationship between monthly interest rate changes and BNPL stock returns (β = -12.89, p = 0.197). Using data from three publicly-traded BNPL providers (February 2020 - August 2025) and benchmark comparisons to credit card issuers, we document that BNPL stocks behave as high-beta growth assets (market β = 2.38) where systematic risk dominates rate sensitivity. Market returns alone explain 42% of BNPL return variation versus only 2.4% for interest rates. Limited statistical power (15-20%) prevents definitive conclusions, but the results suggest stock return sensitivity may differ substantially from firm-level funding cost sensitivity when firms can pass costs through to merchants and consumers. These findings highlight challenges in detecting monetary policy transmission through equity prices of non-bank financial intermediaries.
