## Abstract

This paper examines whether Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) stocks exhibit interest rate sensitivity comparable to traditional financial institutions. Despite firm-level evidence that BNPL funding costs rose 394% as rates increased from near-zero to 5.25%, I find no statistically significant rate sensitivity in monthly stock returns for either BNPL firms (β = -12.89, p = 0.197) or credit card issuers (β = 2.51, p = 0.777) using data from February 2020 to August 2025. BNPL stocks behave as high-beta growth assets (market β = 2.38), with market returns alone explaining 42% of return variation (from bivariate regression: r² = 0.648²) versus only 2.4% for interest rates. Limited statistical power (15-20%) prevents definitive conclusions, but the results suggest that stock return sensitivity may differ substantially from firm-level funding cost sensitivity, particularly when firms can pass costs through to merchants and consumers. These findings highlight challenges in detecting monetary policy transmission through equity prices of non-bank financial intermediaries.
