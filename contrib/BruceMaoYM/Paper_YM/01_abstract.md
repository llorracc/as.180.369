## Abstract

This study examines whether Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) stock returns exhibit interest rate sensitivity consistent with firm-level evidence of near-complete funding cost pass-through. Using monthly data from three publicly traded BNPL providers over 66 months (February 2020–August 2025), I employ multi-factor regressions with heteroskedasticity-robust (HC3) standard errors to estimate rate sensitivity while controlling for market movements and macroeconomic conditions. Despite firm-level evidence of near-complete funding cost pass-through (Laudenbach et al., 2025), BNPL stock returns show no statistically significant relationship with interest rates. Instead, BNPL stocks exhibit high market beta (2.38), behaving like growth-oriented technology assets that amplify systematic risk rather than rate-sensitive financial institutions. Market returns explain 52% of BNPL variation versus only 2% for interest rates. A one percentage point increase in the Federal Funds Rate associates with roughly 12–13% lower BNPL returns, an economically meaningful but statistically imprecise estimate. This disconnect suggests investors price BNPL on growth expectations rather than near-term fundamentals, with implications for fintech valuation and monetary policy transmission.
