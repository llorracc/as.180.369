I document a striking paradox in modern credit markets: Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) firms, despite facilitating substantial consumer credit, show zero sensitivity to Federal Reserve interest rate changes (β₁ = -12.68, SE = 9.95, p = 0.202, R² = 0.022). Using monthly returns from three major BNPL providers (PayPal, Affirm, Sezzle) over 67 months spanning February 2020 to August 2025, I find robust evidence that this rapidly growing sector operates outside traditional monetary policy channels. BNPL returns remain orthogonal to Federal Funds Rate changes, with interest rates explaining less than 2.2% of return variation. This independence persists across multiple specifications and robustness checks.

My findings reveal a growing segment of consumer credit that may undermine monetary policy effectiveness as BNPL adoption expands. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reports BNPL Gross Merchandise Volume grew from USD 2 billion in 2019 to USD 24.2 billion in 2021. This independence reflects a fundamental difference in business models: BNPL firms profit from merchant fees and transaction volume rather than interest rate spreads, operating more like technology platforms than traditional financial intermediaries.

The full specification model achieves an R² of 0.5098, with market returns (β₅ = 2.38, p < 0.001) and inflation (β₄ = -12.94, p = 0.049) dominating BNPL return variation. The Federal Funds Rate coefficient, though economically large, is statistically indistinguishable from zero, indicating that monetary policy affects BNPL firms primarily through indirect channels rather than direct funding cost pass-through visible in stock returns. This research contributes to fintech firm valuation, monetary policy transmission mechanisms, and consumer credit markets research.
