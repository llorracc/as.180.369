## Abstract

This analysis examines the relationship between Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) stock returns and Federal Reserve interest rate changes. Using monthly returns from three major BNPL providers (PayPal, Affirm, Sezzle) over 67 months spanning February 2020 to August 2025, the analysis finds that BNPL stock returns exhibit a negative but statistically insignificant relationship with Federal Funds Rate changes ($\beta_1$ = -12.68, SE = 9.95, p = 0.202, R² = 0.022). While the point estimate is economically large (a one percentage point rate increase is associated with approximately 12.7% lower log returns), the high volatility of BNPL returns (monthly standard deviation of 12.34%) limits statistical power to detect this relationship precisely. Interest rates explain less than 2.2% of return variation, with this pattern persisting across multiple specifications and robustness checks.

The findings suggest that BNPL firms may respond to monetary policy differently than traditional financial institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reports BNPL Gross Merchandise Volume grew from USD 2 billion in 2019 to USD 24.2 billion in 2021. This pattern reflects a fundamental difference in business models: BNPL firms profit from merchant fees and transaction volume rather than interest rate spreads, operating more like technology platforms than traditional financial intermediaries.

The full specification model achieves an R² of 0.5098, with market returns ($\beta_5$ = 2.38, p < 0.001) and inflation ($\beta_4$ = -12.94, p = 0.049) dominating BNPL return variation. The Federal Funds Rate coefficient, though economically meaningful, cannot be statistically distinguished from zero at conventional significance levels, suggesting that monetary policy may affect BNPL firms primarily through indirect channels (market sentiment, inflation effects on consumer purchasing power) rather than direct funding cost pass-through visible in monthly stock returns.
