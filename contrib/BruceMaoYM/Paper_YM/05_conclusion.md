## Conclusion

Affirm Holdings' funding costs increased 394% from fiscal year 2022 to 2024 as the Federal Reserve raised rates from near-zero to 5.25%. Despite this operational exposure, we find no statistically significant relationship between monthly interest rate changes and BNPL stock returns (β = -12.89, SE = 9.99, p = 0.197). Using data from three publicly-traded BNPL providers and benchmark comparisons to credit card issuers, we document that BNPL stocks behave as high-beta growth assets (market β = 2.38) where systematic risk dominates rate sensitivity. Market returns alone explain 42% of BNPL return variation versus only 2.4% for interest rates.

### Reconciling Firm-Level and Stock-Level Sensitivity

The apparent contradiction between substantial funding cost increases and negligible stock return sensitivity reflects three complementary mechanisms. First, forward-looking equity markets incorporated rate expectations before actual rate changes materialized, as the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle was heavily telegraphed through forward guidance beginning in late 2021. Second, BNPL firms demonstrate substantial cost pass-through to merchants and consumers, with recent evidence suggesting 80 to 100% pass-through rates (Laudenbach et al. 2025), meaning funding cost increases may be profit-neutral. Third, as growth-stage firms with negative current earnings, BNPL valuations reflect long-duration growth options where discount rate effects on future profitability dominate current-period cost shocks. The dominance of market beta (2.38) over rate sensitivity is consistent with investors pricing BNPL as technology-enabled growth platforms rather than rate-sensitive financial intermediaries.

### Contributions

This paper makes three contributions to existing literature. First, we provide the first systematic evidence on interest rate sensitivity of publicly-traded BNPL equity returns, documenting that monthly stock returns show no statistically significant relationship to rate changes despite substantial operational rate exposure. Second, we establish that this pattern extends to traditional consumer credit providers, with credit card issuers also exhibiting statistically weak rate sensitivity (β = 2.51, p = 0.777) in monthly data. This benchmark comparison suggests detection challenges affect the entire consumer credit sector rather than reflecting unique BNPL characteristics. Third, we document that BNPL stocks behave as high-beta growth assets where systematic market risk dominates idiosyncratic rate sensitivity, with implications for monetary policy monitoring through equity market signals.

### Implications for Practice and Policy

For investors, the high conditional market beta (2.38) indicates BNPL stocks amplify market movements approximately 2.4 times, suggesting portfolio allocation should account for systematic risk exposure rather than rate sensitivity. The lack of statistically significant interest rate sensitivity in monthly return data suggests growth expectations and competitive dynamics dominate near-term funding cost concerns in valuation. 

For monetary policymakers, these findings suggest equity price signals provide weak early warning indicators for BNPL funding stress. Unlike bank stocks, which exhibit documented negative rate sensitivity (Flannery & James 1984; English et al. 2018), BNPL equities respond primarily to growth expectations and market sentiment, necessitating direct monitoring of operational metrics (including funding costs, merchant volumes, and delinquency rates) rather than reliance on market-based indicators.

### Limitations

Several constraints shape interpretation of these findings. First, limited sample size (66 monthly observations) provides only 15 to 20% statistical power to detect effects of the observed magnitude, meaning we cannot distinguish between genuine absence of rate sensitivity and inability to detect existing sensitivity. Second, the equal-weighted portfolio gives PayPal (where BNPL represents less than 5% of revenue) equal weight to pure-play providers, potentially attenuating BNPL-specific effects, though pure-play subsample analysis yields similar results. Third, monthly return frequency may be too coarse to capture rate sensitivity if effects operate at higher frequencies or with lags as loan portfolios roll over. Fourth, survivorship bias excludes BNPL firms that exited through bankruptcy or distressed acquisitions during the rate cycle (e.g., Afterpay), potentially understating true rate sensitivity. Fifth, the analysis estimates conditional associations rather than causal effects, as interest rate changes reflect endogenous policy responses to economic conditions that independently affect BNPL returns.

### Future Research

Four extensions would strengthen understanding of BNPL rate sensitivity. First, high-frequency event studies examining daily returns around FOMC announcements would isolate the surprise component that moves prices, addressing forward-looking pricing concerns (Bernanke & Kuttner 2005). Second, cross-country quasi-experiments comparing rate sensitivity across regulatory regimes (Australia regulated BNPL in 2022, US in 2024) could test whether regulatory clarity changes how investors price rate risk. Third, examining real outcomes (including transaction volumes, delinquencies, and merchant adoption) could reveal rate sensitivity operating through quantities rather than prices. Fourth, extending the sample period as more BNPL firms enter public markets would increase statistical power and enable detection of effects currently masked by noise.

The central finding (that firm-level funding cost sensitivity does not translate to stock-level return sensitivity) highlights the distinction between operational exposure and equity valuation for growth-stage fintech firms. As the BNPL sector matures and more firms enter public markets, longer time series will enable more definitive tests of rate sensitivity. Until then, the dominance of systematic market risk over idiosyncratic rate effects suggests BNPL stocks are priced primarily as growth assets responding to market-wide risk sentiment rather than as credit-sensitive financial instruments responding directly to monetary policy through funding cost channels.
