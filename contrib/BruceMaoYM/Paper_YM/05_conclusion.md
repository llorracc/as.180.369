## Summary and Conclusions

This study examines how BNPL stock returns respond to Federal Funds Rate changes using monthly data from February 2020 to August 2025. The primary finding is that BNPL stock returns exhibit a negative but statistically insignificant relationship with interest rate changes ($\beta_1 = -12.68$, SE = 9.95, p = 0.202). While the point estimate suggests economically meaningful sensitivity, high volatility of BNPL returns and limited statistical power prevent precise estimation.

Market returns dominate BNPL return variation, with a market beta of 2.38 indicating that BNPL stocks behave like growth-oriented technology companies rather than rate-sensitive financial institutions. Inflation exhibits statistically significant negative effects ($\beta_4 = -12.94$, p = 0.049), suggesting that inflation shocks reduce BNPL returns through multiple channels. Consumer confidence and disposable income show no statistically significant effects.

The divergence between firm-level evidence (showing funding costs respond to interest rates) and stock-level evidence (showing no statistically significant return sensitivity) raises important questions about how investors price BNPL stocks. The high market beta suggests that BNPL stock prices are driven primarily by market sentiment and risk appetite rather than sector-specific fundamentals, which may explain why interest rate sensitivity doesn't manifest clearly in monthly returns.

These findings have implications for investors, who should focus on market sentiment and growth prospects rather than interest rate timing, and for policymakers, who should recognize that BNPL may operate through different transmission channels than traditional financial institutions. The divergence between operational sensitivity and stock return sensitivity warrants further investigation using higher-frequency data or longer time horizons.
