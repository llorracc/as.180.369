## Conclusion

### What We Found: Synthesis, Not Just Summary
This study began with a puzzle: Affirm reported that funding costs rose 394% from fiscal year 2022 to 2024, explicitly attributing the increase to higher benchmark rates (Affirm 10-K, 2024). With near-complete pass-through of monetary policy to funding costs (Laudenbach et al., 2025) and profit margins of roughly 1% of gross merchandise volume, theory predicts BNPL stock returns should be highly rate-sensitive. The evidence is more nuanced. The point estimate of -12.89 implies a one-percentage-point rate hike associates with about 13% lower returns, but the estimate is statistically imprecise (p = 0.197). Market forces dominate: the market beta of 2.38 means BNPL stocks amplify market moves by more than 2:1, and market returns explain ~52% of variation versus ~2% for rates alone. The contribution is documenting this disconnect: firm-level funding costs transmit policy almost fully, yet stock pricing is governed mainly by market sentiment and growth expectations.

### What It Means: Three Interpretations
Three complementary interpretations explain the disconnect. First, statistical power is limited: with 66 monthly observations and 19% volatility, power to detect the observed effect is only about 15–20%, and confidence intervals [-32.6, 7.2] span both strong and weak sensitivity. Second, BNPL trades like a growth platform: high beta, long-duration cash flows, and sentiment-driven valuations mean investors prioritize addressable market and network effects, treating near-term funding-cost moves as transitory noise (e.g., Affirm’s ~70% decline in 2022 despite ~30% revenue growth; Klarna’s 85% valuation drop despite growth). Third, markets may be forward-looking: guidance and futures can embed expected hikes before they occur, so realized monthly ΔFFR misses the surprise component that moves prices. These forces are not mutually exclusive: modest true sensitivity plus limited power and heavy pre-pricing of information yields muted observed effects in monthly returns.

### Practical Implications: Who Cares and Why?
For investors, BNPL is leveraged market exposure (β ≈ 2.38), not a clean rate trade. A 1% BNPL weight adds roughly 2.4% market exposure; to hold a 60% effective equity target, a mix near 57% broad market and 3% BNPL keeps total exposure in line. High beta and ~19% monthly (~66% annualized) volatility mean a 20% market drawdown implies an expected ~48% BNPL decline (wide bands, roughly -30% to -65%), so sizing in the 1–2% range is more proportionate than a “standard” 5% stake. Short-horizon returns are dominated by market risk, so fundamental BNPL signals are better applied over 6–12 month horizons or in relative-value trades (e.g., long Affirm vs short PayPal) that neutralize market exposure.

For policymakers, BNPL’s zero-interest consumer terms blunt the traditional rate channel; if BNPL grows toward 15–20% of consumer credit (vs ~3% now), rate hikes may have less influence on this segment, calling for macroprudential tools or credit limits. Equity prices underweight funding risk, so supervisors should track funding spreads, warehouse covenants, securitization volumes, and credit losses directly rather than relying on stock prices. Given heavy use by financially fragile consumers (about 61% subprime in cited studies), disclosures should emphasize total obligations and aggregate borrowing limits, not only per-transaction terms.

### Limitations: Honest but Constructive
Several constraints shape these results. Sample size is short: 66 months yield low power, though the market-vs-rates R² gap (0.42 vs 0.02) is robust. Identification is associative because ΔFFR is endogenous; multiple specifications (OLS, IV, DiD, Fama-French) test robustness but not full causality, and high-frequency surprises would help. Equal-weight portfolios mask heterogeneity across pure-play, diversified, and bank-licensed models. Outcomes focus on returns, not real activity—volumes, losses, or merchant adoption could reveal transmission even if prices do not. Linear, time-invariant sensitivity may miss thresholds or state dependence.

### Future Research: Motivated Extensions
A focused agenda follows: (1) High-frequency event studies to test reactions to unexpected FOMC surprises in narrow windows; (2) Firm-level panels to see how funding mix, hedging, and business model shape sensitivity (now feasible with more listings, e.g., Klarna); (3) Real effects on credit supply—do originations, approvals, or ticket sizes move with rates; (4) Consumer defaults and repayment—do late pays and charge-offs rise with rates, especially for subprime users, using forthcoming CFPB data; (5) International comparisons across US shadow banks, EU licensed banks, and AU regulated providers to see how regimes influence sensitivity and hedging.

### Final Synthesis: The Big Picture
This study speaks to three literatures. Fintech valuation: BNPL equities trade as high-beta growth assets, not as rate-sensitive lenders, despite clear funding pass-through (Buchak et al., 2018; Laudenbach et al., 2025). Monetary transmission: BNPL’s wholesale funding and zero-interest consumer model alter the credit channel; as BNPL scales, alternative policy levers may be needed. Asset pricing: sector fundamentals (funding costs) can be overwhelmed by systematic risk (market beta, sentiment), revealing a gap between firm-level economics and equity pricing. As BNPL grows from about $2B (2019) toward a projected ~$560B (2025), the stakes rise: do markets price fintech risk efficiently, how effective is policy when credit bypasses banks, and can regulators rely on equity signals when prices underweight funding risk? Answering these questions will guide how BNPL weathers future rate regimes.
