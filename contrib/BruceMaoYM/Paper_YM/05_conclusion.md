## Conclusion

This study quantifies BNPL stock return sensitivity to interest rate changes and compares it to benchmarks from credit card issuers using identical regression specifications. Affirm reported that funding costs increased by 394% (from $69.7 million to $344.3 million, reaching 3.94 times the initial level) from fiscal year 2022 to 2024, explicitly attributing the increase to higher benchmark rates (Affirm 10-K, 2024). However, this increase reflects both volume growth (more loans requiring more funding) and rate effects (higher rates on same volume); without decomposing these effects, the "394% increase" may overstate pure rate sensitivity. Moreover, Laudenbach et al. (2025) show that BNPL firms pass 80–100% of funding cost increases to consumer effective rates and merchant fees, meaning funding cost increases may be profit-neutral if firms maintain pricing power.

The evidence shows BNPL stocks exhibit economically large but statistically insignificant rate sensitivity (β = -12.89, SE = 9.99, p = 0.197, 95% CI: [-32.5, 6.7]). The benchmark comparison with credit card issuers reveals that traditional financial institutions also exhibit statistically weak rate sensitivity in monthly data, suggesting that detecting rate sensitivity in stock returns may be challenging even for rate-sensitive sectors. Market forces dominate: the conditional market beta of approximately 2.4 (estimated with controls for interest rates and macroeconomic factors) means BNPL stocks amplify market moves by approximately 2.4 times, and market returns alone explain approximately 42% of variation (from bivariate regression: r² = 0.648²) versus 2.4% for rates alone.

**Theoretical contribution:** This analysis documents that BNPL stocks exhibit patterns consistent with high-beta growth assets in monthly return data, but the benchmark comparison suggests that traditional financial institutions face similar challenges in detecting rate sensitivity. The results are most consistent with prediction 2 (complete cost pass-through, β ≈ 0) or prediction 4 (lagged sensitivity) from Section 2.4, rather than prediction 1 (stronger negative sensitivity than banks) or prediction 3 (regulatory arbitrage). The observed coefficient magnitude (β = -12.89) is consistent with prediction 1's range (-10 to -15) but lacks statistical significance, which aligns better with prediction 2's mechanism of complete pass-through preventing funding cost effects from reaching stock returns. The pattern is consistent with rational, forward-looking valuation where stock prices reflect long-term growth options rather than current-period funding costs, or with forward-looking pricing where rate expectations are incorporated before actual rate changes materialize. The statistical uncertainty means this interpretation should be treated cautiously, but the economic magnitude suggests either genuine economic independence (cost pass-through) or systematic challenges in detecting rate sensitivity in monthly stock return data.

Three complementary interpretations explain the relationship between firm-level funding costs and stock-level statistically insignificant sensitivity. First, statistical power is limited: with 66 monthly observations and 19% volatility, power to detect the observed effect is only about 15–20%, and confidence intervals [-32.5, 6.7] span both strong and weak sensitivity. Second, forward-looking pricing: the Fed's tightening cycle was heavily telegraphed starting in late 2021 through forward guidance, dot plots, and Fed communications. If stock prices incorporate expectations, then realized monthly rate changes (captured by ΔFFR) should have minimal impact because they were already priced in. Third, BNPL trades like a growth platform: high beta, long-duration cash flows, and sentiment-driven valuations mean investors prioritize addressable market and network effects, treating near-term funding-cost moves as transitory noise (e.g., Affirm's ~70% decline in 2022 despite ~30% revenue growth). These forces are not mutually exclusive: modest true sensitivity plus limited power and heavy pre-pricing of information yields muted observed effects in monthly returns.

**Distinguishing Firm-Level and Stock-Level Sensitivity:**

A critical distinction separates firm-level funding cost sensitivity from stock return sensitivity. Firm-level evidence shows funding cost increases, but stock return sensitivity depends on whether investors anticipated these costs, whether firms can pass costs through, and whether growth expectations dominate valuation. The divergence between firm-level evidence (showing funding cost increases) and stock-level evidence (showing no statistically significant return sensitivity) is therefore not necessarily a puzzle. Instead, it reflects the distinction between operational sensitivity and equity valuation sensitivity, which can diverge for growth-stage firms where stock prices reflect long-term growth options rather than current-period costs.

These findings have direct implications for different stakeholders. For investors, BNPL stocks exhibit high conditional market beta (2.38), behaving like growth-oriented technology assets. The lack of statistically significant interest rate sensitivity in monthly return data suggests investors should focus on market sentiment, competitive dynamics, and regulatory developments rather than trying to time monetary policy, though this finding is based on limited statistical power and may not reflect the true underlying relationship.

**Regulatory implications:** Given the limited evidence base—three firms over 66 months with 15-20% statistical power—policy recommendations should be cautious. I provide descriptive evidence on co-movement patterns between BNPL stock returns and monetary policy variables, but do not establish causal relationships or provide sufficient evidence to justify specific regulatory or monetary policy interventions. Future research with larger samples, longer time horizons, and more detailed firm-level data would be needed to inform policy decisions about BNPL funding structures, regulatory monitoring, or monetary policy transmission channels.

Several constraints shape these results. Sample size is short: 66 months yield low power, though the market-vs-rates R² gap (0.42 vs 0.02) is robust. Identification is associative because ΔFFR is endogenous; multiple specifications (OLS, IV, DiD, Fama-French) test robustness but not full causality, and high-frequency surprises would help. Equal-weight portfolios mask heterogeneity across pure-play, diversified, and bank-licensed models. Outcomes focus on returns, not real activity—volumes, losses, or merchant adoption could reveal transmission even if prices do not. Linear, time-invariant sensitivity may miss thresholds or state dependence.

A focused research agenda follows: (1) High-frequency event studies using daily returns for ±3 days around FOMC announcements, regressing "FOMC window returns" on rate surprises (actual minus expected from Fed Funds futures), following Bernanke and Kuttner (2005). This would isolate the surprise component that moves prices, avoiding the averaging problem in monthly data. (2) Cross-country quasi-experiment: Australia regulated BNPL in 2022, UK is implementing regulations in 2026, US did so in 2024. Use difference-in-differences comparing rate sensitivity of Australian BNPL (post-regulation) versus US BNPL (pre-regulation) to test whether regulatory clarity changes how investors price rate risk. (3) Merger analysis: Square acquired Afterpay in 2022 for $29 billion. Study returns around the acquisition to test whether the combined entity shows different rate sensitivity post-merger, revealing whether portfolio diversification within fintech reduces rate exposure. (4) Bank charter experiment: Affirm announced its bank charter pursuit in 2023, obtained it in 2024. Use event study around announcement and approval dates to test whether rate sensitivity changed discretely when funding costs shifted from securitization to deposits.

This study speaks to three literatures. Fintech valuation: BNPL equities exhibit patterns consistent with high-beta growth assets in monthly return data, though the benchmark comparison suggests traditional financial institutions face similar challenges in detecting rate sensitivity. Monetary transmission: BNPL's wholesale funding and zero-interest consumer model may alter the credit channel; as BNPL scales, alternative policy levers may be needed, though stronger evidence would be required to draw policy conclusions. Asset pricing: sector fundamentals (funding costs) may be overwhelmed by systematic risk (market beta, sentiment) in equity pricing, revealing a potential gap between firm-level economics and equity pricing, though the data cannot establish this pattern. As BNPL grows from about $2 billion (2019) to substantial scale, the stakes rise: do markets price fintech risk efficiently, how effective is policy when credit bypasses banks, and can regulators rely on equity signals when prices may underweight funding risk? Answering these questions will guide how BNPL weathers future rate regimes, though stronger empirical evidence would be needed to inform policy.
