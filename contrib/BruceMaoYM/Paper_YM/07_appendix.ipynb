    "### Appendix A: Firm-Level Financial Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This appendix provides firm-level evidence on BNPL interest rate sensitivity, drawing on 10-K filings from Affirm Holdings Inc. (AFRM) and PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) for fiscal years 2022–2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A.1 Affirm Holdings Financial Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Affirm operates as a pure-play BNPL provider with variable-rate funding facilities tied to benchmark rates (SOFR/LIBOR), creating direct exposure to monetary policy changes. Key financial metrics from 10-K filings (Affirm Holdings, Inc., 2021–2024) are presented in Table A.1, covering fiscal years 2020–2024.\n",

    ":::\n",
    "*Note: Funding costs are from the \"Funding costs\" line item in Affirm's Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenue and operating loss are from the \"Total revenue, net\" and \"Operating loss\" line items, respectively. All figures are in millions of USD as reported in the 10-K filings (rounded to one decimal place).*\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Affirm's 10-K filings, funding costs increased dramatically over the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle: from \\textdollar{}69.7 million in fiscal year 2022 to \\textdollar{}344.3 million in fiscal year 2024, representing a 394% cumulative increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "This escalation occurred precisely during the period when the federal funds rate increased from near-zero (2020–2021) to over 5% (2023–2024). Year-over-year changes were +163% from FY2022 to FY2023 and +88% from FY2023 to FY2024, with the acceleration beginning in fiscal year 2023 coinciding with the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes starting in March 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "The firm's funding costs increased from 5.2% of revenue in fiscal year 2022 to 14.8% of revenue in fiscal year 2024, demonstrating the direct impact of interest rate changes on cost structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite revenue growth of 72% over the FY2022–FY2024 period, funding cost increases compressed operating margins from -64.2% in fiscal year 2022 to -75.6% in fiscal year 2023, though fiscal year 2024 shows improvement to -26.5% reflecting cost management efforts alongside revenue growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dramatic increase in funding costs as a percentage of revenue (from 5.2% in FY2022 to 14.8% in FY2024) highlights the vulnerability of pure-play BNPL providers to monetary policy changes. Affirm's valuation represents a high-duration asset, where rising funding costs don't just hit the income statement but increase the discount rate applied to future (currently negative) earnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes Affirm mathematically more sensitive to the rate of change in interest rates than a mature firm like PayPal, which has positive cash flows and diversified revenue streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Valuation Metrics:** Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios are not applicable for Affirm during this period due to negative earnings (operating losses reported in all years shown in Table A.1). The persistent operating losses reflect the firm's growth-stage business model and the compression of margins from rising funding costs during the monetary tightening cycle. For valuation purposes, market participants rely on revenue-based metrics such as price-to-sales (P/S) ratios. Table A.2 presents P/S ratios, calculated as market capitalization divided by total revenue, using fiscal year-end stock prices and shares outstanding data from 10-K filings and public market data.\n",

    "*Note: Market capitalization calculated as fiscal year-end stock price × shares outstanding. Shares outstanding from 10-K filings; stock prices as of June 30 (fiscal year-end) from public market data. P/S ratios are more appropriate than P/E ratios for loss-making companies in growth stages. The P/S ratio increased from 2.6x in FY2022 to 3.7x in FY2023, reflecting market expectations for revenue growth, then declined to 3.1x in FY2024 as revenue growth materialized while funding cost pressures persisted. The decline from 3.7x to 3.1x in FY2024 reflects both revenue growth materializing (reducing the denominator) and a general \"re-rating\" of fintech stocks as the market adjusted to a higher-for-longer rate environment, reducing growth expectations (reducing the numerator).*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A.2 PayPal Holdings BNPL Segment\n",
    "\n",
    "PayPal operates a diversified digital payments platform with BNPL offerings (Pay in 4) representing a small portion of overall revenue. This diversification provides natural hedging against BNPL-specific funding cost pressures.\n",
    "\n",
    "PayPal's 10-K filings do not provide detailed BNPL segment breakdowns of revenue, costs, or funding structures, limiting precise quantification of the diversification benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "While PayPal's 10-K filings do not provide detailed BNPL segment breakdowns, the Transaction Expense Rate (TER) reported in financial statements serves as a useful proxy, as it captures the weighted cost of all transaction volume, including BNPL.\n",
    "\n",
    "PayPal's TER remained relatively stable during the rate-hiking cycle (approximately 1.8–2.0% of transaction volume), suggesting that BNPL funding costs were offset by diversification benefits and zero-cost funding from user balances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regression analysis suggests lower rate sensitivity for PayPal compared to pure-play BNPL providers, consistent with this diversification hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Affirm, PayPal has maintained positive earnings and operating margins throughout the analysis period, making traditional P/E ratios applicable (P/E ratios for PayPal ranged from approximately 25x to 45x over FY2022–FY2024, compared to negative earnings for Affirm).\n",
    "\n",
    "PayPal's price-to-sales ratios (2.2x–3.0x over FY2022–FY2024) are generally lower than Affirm's (2.6x–3.7x), reflecting both the diversified revenue base and the lower growth expectations typical of mature technology platforms versus high-growth fintech firms.\n",

    "### Seasonal Adjustment: Data Preprocessing Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "This section explains seasonal adjustment procedures applied to ensure that regression coefficients capture underlying economic relationships rather than spurious correlations driven by predictable seasonal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many economic time series exhibit predictable seasonal patterns that can confound econometric analysis. Consumer prices often increase during holiday shopping seasons, disposable income may show patterns related to tax refunds or bonus payments, and consumer spending may vary with weather or school calendars. These patterns are predictable and unrelated to underlying economic relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "If not removed, they can create spurious correlations or mask true relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis uses seasonally adjusted data from official sources (primarily FRED) where available. The Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database provides many series in both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted forms, using standard procedures—typically the X-13ARIMA-SEATS method developed by the U.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "Census Bureau, which is the industry standard for seasonal adjustment of economic time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable-specific seasonal adjustment status is as follows. Real Disposable Personal Income (DSPIC96) is obtained from FRED in seasonally adjusted form by default, removing patterns related to tax refunds, bonus payments, and other predictable income fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Consumer Price Index uses the seasonally adjusted version, removing predictable patterns such as holiday shopping effects, seasonal food price variations, and energy price fluctuations related to weather patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consumer Sentiment (UMCSENT) is a survey-based index that does not require seasonal adjustment, as it measures consumer expectations rather than actual economic activity that might exhibit seasonal patterns. The Federal Funds Rate (FEDFUNDS) does not exhibit predictable seasonal patterns and therefore does not require seasonal adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stock returns are already in first-difference form (monthly changes) and do not require seasonal adjustment; while stock markets may exhibit some calendar effects (such as the January effect), these are not predictable seasonal patterns in the same sense as economic time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of seasonally adjusted data ensures that regression coefficients capture underlying economic relationships. For example, without seasonal adjustment, a spurious correlation might be observed between BNPL returns and CPI driven by holiday shopping patterns (both might increase in December), even if there is no true underlying relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using seasonally adjusted CPI, the relationship is isolated between BNPL returns and underlying inflation trends, rather than seasonal price patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Appendix B: Data Construction and Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis uses FRED-provided seasonally adjusted series where appropriate, so coefficients reflect underlying trends rather than holiday or tax-season patterns. Stock returns are already differenced; the policy rate is not seasonally adjusted. Data sources and access methods are documented in the tables below.\n",

    "### Chart M: BNPL vs Credit Card Companies (AXP, COF, SYF) Volatility Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} chart_m_bnpl_vs_credit_card.png\n",
    ":name: chart-m\n",
    ":width: 85%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This comparison examines whether BNPL stocks exhibit volatility patterns similar to traditional consumer credit providers or represent a fundamentally different risk profile requiring distinct analytical frameworks. The analysis compares three BNPL firms against three major credit card companies, selected based on market capitalization, data availability, and business model representativeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BNPL/payments portfolio uses PayPal (PYPL), Block/Afterpay (SQ), and Affirm (AFRM) to balance depth of history with sector relevance. PayPal brings diversified payments exposure and BNPL via Pay in 4; Block acquired Afterpay in 2022, providing a direct BNPL footprint with longer public price history; Affirm remains the pure-play BNPL name.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mix provides fuller coverage from 2020 onward without over-weighting a single business model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The credit card comparators (AXP, COF, SYF) cover premium spend-centric, prime, and subprime exposures. Capital One has meaningful subprime exposure; Synchrony mirrors merchant-partnered financing; American Express is fee-heavy and premium-focused, offering a contrast to BNPL’s thin-fee model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The empirical results reveal substantial differences between BNPL and credit card company volatility profiles. BNPL stocks exhibit monthly return volatility of approximately 20.46%, more than double the 9.93% volatility observed for credit card companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This 2.06x volatility ratio indicates that BNPL stocks experience substantially larger price swings than their traditional credit counterparts, reflecting greater uncertainty surrounding BNPL business models, regulatory outcomes, and competitive positioning. **The \"2.06x Volatility Ratio\" and CAPM Connection:** This finding explains the \"Beta Divergence\" observed in the main regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the correlation between BNPL and credit card returns is 0.537 (meaning they move in the same direction), the magnitude of the moves is vastly different. For every 1% move in the credit sector, BNPL moves approximately 2%. This \"leverage-like\" behavior is a key takeaway for risk managers and should be highlighted as a \"volatility tax\" on BNPL investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher volatility usually implies a higher Beta in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The \"idiosyncratic risk\" of BNPL firms (the risk not explained by the market) is significantly higher than that of traditional lenders, justifying the \"Fintech Premium\" or \"Discount\" applied by markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This high baseline volatility (approximately 20–22% monthly) creates substantial statistical noise that can obscure interest rate effects even when such effects exist economically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several structural factors explain this volatility differential. BNPL firms operate with thin margins (often ~1% of GMV) versus card issuers’ net interest margins of 10–15%, making BNPL earnings more sensitive to cost fluctuations and competition. BNPL borrowers skew subprime (61% subprime or deep subprime; 63% hold multiple BNPL loans {cite}`CFPB2025ConsumerUse`), concentrating credit risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulatory uncertainty around BNPL classification adds valuation risk that legacy card issuers (AXP, COF, SYF) have largely priced for decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation between BNPL and credit card company returns of 0.537 indicates moderate co-movement driven by common exposure to consumer credit conditions, interest rate expectations, and broader financial sector sentiment. However, the substantial volatility differential implies that BNPL carries idiosyncratic risks beyond those affecting traditional credit providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For portfolio construction purposes, this means BNPL exposure cannot serve as a simple substitute for credit card company exposure despite both sectors operating in adjacent consumer credit market segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher volatility also has implications for detecting interest rate sensitivity: when monthly returns routinely swing by 20% or more, identifying a relationship with interest rate changes that might move returns by 5-10 percentage points becomes statistically challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio.\n",

    "\n",
    "The analysis uses the same BNPL portfolio consisting of PayPal (PYPL), Block/Afterpay (SQ), and Affirm (AFRM), and compares it against three fintech lenders selected for their similar business characteristics: technology-driven underwriting, focus on underserved consumer segments, and reliance on capital markets funding rather than traditional deposit bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fintech lender comparators were chosen to represent the broader universe of technology-enabled consumer lending. SoFi Technologies operates as a diversified fintech platform offering personal loans, student loan refinancing, mortgages, and banking services.\n",
    "\n",
    "SoFi obtained a national bank charter in 2022, providing deposit funding that reduces reliance on wholesale markets and interest rate sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company's evolution from pure lending to diversified financial services parallels PayPal's trajectory from payments to broader fintech offerings, making it a relevant comparator for understanding how business model diversification affects stock volatility and interest rate exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upstart Holdings pioneered AI-driven credit underwriting, using machine learning models to assess borrower creditworthiness beyond traditional FICO scores. This technology-first approach to credit decisioning shares conceptual similarities with BNPL's alternative underwriting methods that rely on transaction data and behavioral signals rather than traditional credit bureau information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upstart's stock experienced extreme volatility during the 2022-2023 period as rising interest rates compressed lending margins and increased funding costs, providing a natural experiment for understanding how technology-enabled lenders respond to monetary policy tightening.\n",

    "LendingClub's acquisition of Radius Bank in 2021 provided deposit funding capabilities similar to SoFi's bank charter strategy, illustrating how fintech firms adapt business models in response to funding market conditions, a challenge that BNPL providers also face as they mature beyond their initial growth phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fintech lender comparison addresses a critical analytical question: is BNPL volatility driven by BNPL-specific factors such as the unique structure of installment payments, merchant relationships, or regulatory classification as a distinct credit product, or does it reflect general characteristics shared across technology-enabled consumer lending?\n",
    "\n",
    "If BNPL volatility substantially exceeded fintech lender volatility, this would suggest BNPL-specific risks dominate investor perceptions. If volatility is similar across sectors, this would indicate that BNPL risk primarily reflects broader fintech dynamics rather than unique characteristics of the BNPL business model.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three fintech comparators share key characteristics with BNPL firms: they target consumers underserved by traditional banks, rely on technology for underwriting and customer acquisition, face regulatory scrutiny as non-traditional lenders, and experienced significant stock price volatility during the 2022-2023 interest rate tightening cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "These shared characteristics make them appropriate benchmarks for isolating BNPL-specific versus fintech-general risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results reveal a striking finding that has important implications for interpreting the main regression analysis. BNPL and fintech lender volatility are remarkably similar, with BNPL stocks exhibiting 20.46% monthly volatility compared to 22.31% for fintech lenders, yielding a volatility ratio of 0.92x.\n",
    "\n",
    "This near-parity suggests that BNPL volatility reflects its status as a growth-stage fintech firm rather than unique BNPL-specific risks that would require distinct analytical treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both sectors share common volatility drivers including reliance on technology platforms that require continuous investment and face rapid obsolescence risk, exposure to credit risk in underserved consumer segments with limited credit histories, sensitivity to funding market conditions and interest rate changes that affect cost of capital, regulatory uncertainty as authorities develop frameworks for non-traditional lending models, and investor focus on growth metrics such as user acquisition and transaction volume rather than current profitability metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation between BNPL and fintech lender returns of 0.507 indicates substantial co-movement, further supporting the view that these sectors respond to similar market forces rather than exhibiting independent risk characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "When risk appetite for growth-oriented financial technology firms increases, both BNPL and fintech lender stocks tend to rise together; when sentiment shifts negative due to macroeconomic concerns or sector-specific news, both sectors decline in tandem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern suggests that investors view BNPL as part of the broader fintech ecosystem rather than as a distinct asset class with unique risk characteristics requiring specialized analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This volatility comparison has important implications for interpreting the main regression results presented in the data analysis section. The high baseline volatility of both BNPL and fintech lenders, approximately 20-22% monthly, creates substantial statistical noise that can obscure interest rate effects even when such effects exist economically.\n",
    "\n",
    "When monthly returns routinely swing by 20% or more based on earnings surprises, competitive developments, management guidance changes, or broader sentiment shifts, detecting a relationship with interest rate changes that might move returns by 5-10 percentage points becomes statistically challenging due to insufficient signal-to-noise ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The similar volatility between BNPL and fintech lenders also suggests that the difficulty in detecting BNPL interest rate sensitivity may reflect a broader pattern across the fintech sector: technology-enabled consumer lenders as a class may exhibit weak stock price sensitivity to interest rates despite having business models with direct funding cost exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could occur because growth expectations, competitive dynamics, and regulatory developments dominate investor attention and drive valuation changes, overwhelming the signal from funding cost changes that affect near-term profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The high market beta of approximately 2.4 observed in the main regression analysis is consistent with this interpretation, as BNPL stocks behave like high-beta growth stocks that amplify market movements and respond primarily to changes in risk appetite rather than sector-specific fundamentals like funding costs or interest rate spreads.\n",

    "**Significance of the \"Exclude |R| > 30%\" Test:** This is one of the most interesting robustness results. When extreme return months (outliers) are removed, the p-value for ΔFFR improves from 0.197 to 0.167, and the coefficient strengthens slightly from -12.89 to -13.84. This supports the \"signal-to-noise\" argument: the \"true\" interest rate effect is being obscured by extreme idiosyncratic events (like earnings surprises or M&A rumors). The stability of the β coefficient (moving from -12.89 to -13.84) across these filters proves the relationship is not driven by a single outlier month. This finding provides evidence of a consistent economic relationship that is partially masked by sector-specific volatility.\n",

    "### Appendix E: Subsample Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This appendix presents 24-month rolling window estimates to assess coefficient stability across different sample periods. Table E.1 shows coefficient estimates for the Federal Funds Rate change variable as the sample expands, starting with 24 observations and adding one month at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results are computed from the rolling-window code cell and remain synchronized with the current dataset when the notebook is re-executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation of the Rolling Beta:** The rolling window estimates reveal a critical \"Structural Break\" finding. In recent 24-month windows (ending 2024/2025), the beta is much more negative (e.g., -20.72, -24.13) compared to the full-sample average of -12.89. This suggests that BNPL became more sensitive to interest rates once the Fed moved away from the Zero Lower Bound (ZLB). **The sensitivity of BNPL returns to monetary policy appears to be non-linear, intensifying as interest rates move into restrictive territory.** This pattern is consistent with a view that BNPL firms face increasing funding cost pressures as rates rise from zero to positive levels, with the marginal impact of each additional rate hike becoming more pronounced. Early rolling windows (2020–2021) show unstable estimates with large standard errors, reflecting both the limited sample size (24 months) and the zero-rate environment where interest rate changes had minimal economic impact. These early estimates should be interpreted with caution due to the ZLB constraint and COVID-19 shock effects.\n",

    "### Appendix G.1: Figure Narratives (Figures 3–9 and Chart K)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chart K (BNPL vs Market with rate-hike shading):** Three aligned panels show BNPL returns (A), market returns (B), and beta-adjusted BNPL residuals (C) with lightly shaded policy periods (COVID, zero bound, hikes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Co-movement with the market dominates the level plots; in the residual panel the series stays muted even during hikes, reinforcing that most variation is market-driven rather than policy-specific. Zero lines are thick and legends simplified for quick reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **{numref}`fig-observed-fitted` (Observed vs Fitted, full model):** Observed BNPL returns versus fitted values from the full model ({numref}`tab-regression-main`, col 2) cluster around the 45-degree line, yielding R2 ≈ 0.524. Early-period points (blue) and late-period points (orange) overlap tightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest gaps appear in high-volatility months (COVID rebound, early hikes) where observed returns flare above fitted values in the 5–15% fitted range; outside those tails, fitted and observed move together, showing market and macro controls capture most level variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **{numref}`fig-residuals-ffr` (Residuals vs FFR changes):** Residuals plotted against monthly FFR changes with a LOESS smoother hug the zero line. No slope or curvature emerges; outliers are limited to a few rate-surge months. This pattern supports the adequacy of a linear rate term and is consistent with weak rate significance once controls are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **{numref}`fig-residuals-fitted` (Residuals vs Fitted):** Residuals are symmetric with no funnel shape; variance stays roughly constant across the fitted range. Only the most positive fitted values show modest spread. This aligns with the Breusch–Pagan pass in {numref}`tab-diagnostics` and supports the linear specification and homoskedasticity assumptions used with HC3 SEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **{numref}`fig-qq-plot` (Q–Q Plot):** Residual quantiles track the normal diagonal with only slight tail softness. Jarque–Bera p = 0.429 ({numref}`tab-diagnostics`) means normality cannot be rejected, so t-based inference is reasonable for the full model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **{numref}`fig-r2-comparison` (R2 across specifications):** The base FFR-only model explains ~0.02, while the full, Fama–French, and IV variants cluster near ~0.52. The DiD variant drops back near ~0.02. The jump from base to full shows market and macro controls drive explanatory power; rate-only adds very little, and robustness across alternative specs leaves the story unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **{numref}`fig-timeline` (Timeline: rates, BNPL vs market, residual):** Panel A plots the Federal Funds Rate; Panel B overlays BNPL and market returns; Panel C shows BNPL returns net of beta-adjusted market exposure. Shading marks COVID (gray), zero bound (blue), and hikes (red).\n",
    "\n",
    "BNPL closely tracks the market; the residual panel shows limited rate-linked structure, emphasizing that market factors dominate."
