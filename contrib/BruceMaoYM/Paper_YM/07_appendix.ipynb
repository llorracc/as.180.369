    "### Appendix A: Firm-Level Financial Analysis (Full Detail)\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide detailed context for understanding BNPL firms and their sensitivity to macroeconomic conditions, this section examines the financial characteristics of two major firms in the BNPL space: PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) and Affirm Holdings Inc. (AFRM). This analysis draws directly from annual 10-K filings filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from 2021-2024, providing granular insights into firm-level mechanisms that explain sector-wide patterns. A condensed firm-level summary now appears in the main text; this appendix retains the full detail for replication and reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "PayPal and Affirm represent distinct business models within the broader BNPL and digital payments ecosystem, making them useful case studies for understanding how different approaches to BNPL respond to macroeconomic conditions. PayPal, established in 1998, operates a diversified digital payments platform with revenue streams from traditional payment processing, merchant services, and BNPL offerings (notably PayPal Pay in 4, launched in 2020). This diversification means that BNPL represents only a portion of PayPal's overall business, providing natural hedging against BNPL-specific risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Affirm, founded in 2012 and completing its initial public offering in 2021, operates as a pure-play BNPL provider focused exclusively on point-of-sale financing solutions. This focused business model means that Affirm's performance is more directly tied to BNPL-specific factors, making it a clearer case study for understanding how BNPL firms respond to macroeconomic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis has the following limitations. Examining only two firms limits generalizability to other BNPL providers or fintech firms. PayPal's BNPL services represent a relatively small portion of its overall business, making it difficult to isolate BNPL-specific effects from broader PayPal performance. Firm-level financial data may be influenced by many factors beyond macroeconomic conditions, including firm-specific strategies, competitive dynamics, management decisions, and regulatory changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examination of Affirm's 10-K filings from 2021-2024 reveals a business model that is fundamentally dependent on external funding sources with variable interest rates, creating direct exposure to monetary policy changes. According to Affirm's 2024 10-K filing, the company maintains warehouse credit facilities with aggregate borrowing capacity of approximately USD 183.0 million, which mature between 2025 and 2028. These facilities are complemented by securitization programs and forward flow commitments. Critically, these funding sources typically carry variable interest rates tied to benchmark rates such as SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) or LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), though the exact terms vary by facility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of interest rate changes on Affirm's funding costs is reported explicitly in the company's financial statements. \n",
    "According to Affirm's 2024 10-K filing, funding costs increased dramatically over the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle. \n",
    "In fiscal year 2022 (ended June 30, 2022), funding costs totaled USD 183.0 million. \n",
    "This period largely predates the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes that began in March 2022, though some rate increases occurred in the latter part of the fiscal year. \n",
    "In fiscal year 2023 (ended June 30, 2023), funding costs increased to USD 183.0 million, representing a 163% increase from the prior year. \n",
    "This period overlaps substantially with the Federal Reserve's rate increases, which raised the federal funds rate from near-zero to approximately 4.5-5.0% by mid-2023. \n",
    "In fiscal year 2024 (ended June 30, 2024), funding costs reached USD 183.0 million, an 88% increase from fiscal year 2023. \n",
    "The filing explicitly states that this increase was \"primarily due to higher benchmark interest rates.\" Cumulatively, funding costs increased by approximately 394% from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dramatic escalation in funding costs directly demonstrates the mechanism through which monetary policy affects BNPL firms: as benchmark rates increase, the variable-rate components of Affirm's funding facilities reset at higher rates, increasing the cost of capital. The 394% increase in funding costs over two years, during a period when the federal funds rate increased from near-zero to over 5%, provides concrete evidence of the direct pass-through mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, funding costs may be influenced by factors other than interest rates, including changes in the size of the loan portfolio, shifts in the mix of funding sources (warehouse facilities versus securitization), changes in credit spreads, and modifications to facility terms. Management's attribution of the increase primarily to benchmark rate changes indicates that interest rate movements are a significant driver, though other factors may also play roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Affirm's gross receivables, which represent the principal amount of loans outstanding, declined from USD 183.0 million as of June 30, 2023 to USD 183.0 million as of June 30, 2024. This decline reflects several factors: portfolio runoff as existing loans mature, tighter underwriting standards in response to higher funding costs or credit concerns, strategic portfolio management decisions, changes in consumer demand for BNPL products, or shifts in merchant partnerships. Without more granular data, it is difficult to determine the relative importance of each factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vintage composition of the portfolio also matters for interest rate sensitivity. Loans originated during periods of low interest rates (e.g., 2020-2021) may have been priced assuming lower funding costs. When these loans are refinanced or when new loans are originated to replace maturing ones, the higher funding costs reduce margins. However, Affirm's 10-K filings do not provide detailed vintage analysis that would allow quantification of this effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Affirm's total revenue (net) increased from USD 183.0 million in fiscal year 2022 to USD 183.0 million in fiscal year 2024, representing a 72% increase over two years. \n",
    "Over the same period, funding costs increased from USD 183.0 million to USD 183.0 million, a 394% increase. \n",
    "This divergence indicates that revenue growth alone is not sufficient to offset the margin compression from rising funding costs, at least in the short to medium term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several caveats are important. First, revenue and funding costs are not directly comparable. Revenue represents gross income while funding costs are one component of expenses. A more appropriate comparison would examine operating margins or net income, which incorporate all expenses. Second, the relationship between revenue and funding costs may be non-linear or subject to lags. Third, Affirm may be able to adjust pricing (merchant fees or consumer interest rates) over time to partially offset funding cost increases, though such adjustments could affect transaction volume. Fourth, revenue growth may reflect factors other than underlying business health, such as one-time gains or accounting changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative examination using data from Yahoo Finance (as of the most recent fiscal year) shows that Affirm exhibits a debt-to-assets ratio of 70.40% and an operating margin of 10.48%. The high debt-to-assets ratio indicates substantial financial leverage, which amplifies the impact of interest rate changes on profitability. Higher leverage means that a given increase in interest expense represents a larger proportion of operating income, making the firm more sensitive to rate movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Affirm's operating margin of 10.48% leaves relatively little buffer to absorb cost increases. Operating margins vary significantly across business models and may not fully capture the economic sensitivity to interest rates. Operating margins may also be influenced by accounting choices, one-time items, and non-operating factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "PayPal operates a more diversified business model than Affirm, with revenue streams from payment processing, merchant services, and other fintech offerings in addition to BNPL services (Pay in 4). This diversification provides natural hedging against BNPL-specific funding cost pressures. If BNPL represents a relatively small portion of PayPal's overall revenue and operations, then funding cost increases specific to BNPL have a smaller proportional impact on the firm's overall profitability and stock price.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, PayPal's 10-K filings do not provide detailed breakdowns of BNPL-specific revenue, costs, or funding structures, making it difficult to quantify the extent of this diversification benefit. Additionally, PayPal's lower estimated sensitivity in regression analysis could reflect factors other than diversification, such as differences in funding structure, market perceptions, investor composition, or other firm characteristics that cannot be observed directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The firm-level evidence presented above demonstrates several mechanisms through which BNPL firms are sensitive to interest rate changes, providing microeconomic foundations for the empirical analysis. First, variable-rate funding facilities create direct exposure to benchmark rate changes, as evidenced by Affirm's 394% increase in funding costs from 2022 to 2024, which occurred precisely during the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle. This direct pass-through mechanism indicates that interest rate changes have immediate effects on BNPL firms' cost structures, which are reflected in stock returns. Second, high leverage (as seen in Affirm's 70.40% debt-to-assets ratio) means that interest expense increases represent a larger proportion of operating income, amplifying the impact on profitability. Third, thin operating margins (Affirm's 10.48%) leave less buffer to absorb cost increases, meaning that even small increases in funding costs significantly affect profitability. Fourth, in the short term, BNPL providers have limited ability to adjust merchant fees or consumer interest rates to offset funding cost increases, particularly if competitive pressures constrain pricing adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "These mechanisms collectively provide strong theoretical motivation for expecting negative coefficients on Federal Funds Rate changes in the regression analysis. The documented 394% increase in funding costs, combined with thin margins and high leverage, indicates that BNPL stock returns respond negatively to interest rate increases. Stock returns are influenced by many factors beyond funding costs, including market sentiment, competitive dynamics, broader economic conditions, and firm-specific news. The regression analysis addresses these by controlling for market returns, consumer confidence, disposable income, and inflation, allowing isolation of the effect of interest rate changes while accounting for other factors that may confound the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis has the following limitations. The focus on two firms limits generalizability to other BNPL providers or fintech firms. The relationship between funding costs and stock returns may be subject to lags, expectations, and other factors not captured in this analysis. Reliance on annual 10-K filings provides snapshots at fiscal year-end and may not capture intra-year dynamics. The attribution of funding cost increases to interest rates relies on management's statements, which may not capture all relevant factors. Stock returns are influenced by many factors beyond funding costs, including market sentiment, competitive dynamics, broader economic conditions, and firm-specific news. Correlation does not imply causation, and the relationships observed may reflect omitted variables or reverse causality.\n",

    "### Seasonal Adjustment: Data Preprocessing Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "This section explains the seasonal adjustment procedures applied to the data to ensure that regression coefficients capture underlying economic relationships rather than spurious correlations driven by predictable seasonal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many economic time series exhibit predictable seasonal patterns that can confound econometric analysis. For example, consumer prices often increase during holiday shopping seasons, disposable income may show seasonal patterns related to tax refunds or bonus payments, and consumer spending may vary with weather patterns or school calendars. These seasonal patterns are predictable and unrelated to the underlying economic relationships the analysis seeks to estimate. If not removed, seasonal patterns can create spurious correlations or mask true relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis uses seasonally adjusted data from official sources (primarily FRED) where available. The Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database provides many series in both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted forms. FRED uses standard seasonal adjustment procedures, typically the X-13ARIMA-SEATS method developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, which is the industry standard for seasonal adjustment of economic time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following variables are used with their seasonal adjustment status. Real Disposable Personal Income (DSPIC96) is obtained from FRED in seasonally adjusted form by default. This series removes seasonal patterns related to tax refunds, bonus payments, and other predictable income fluctuations. The Consumer Price Index (CPIAUCSLSA) uses the seasonally adjusted version rather than the non-seasonally adjusted version. Seasonal adjustment removes predictable patterns such as holiday shopping effects, seasonal food price variations, and energy price fluctuations related to weather patterns. Consumer Sentiment (UMCSENT) is a survey-based index that does not require seasonal adjustment, as it measures consumer expectations rather than actual economic activity that might exhibit seasonal patterns. The Federal Funds Rate (FEDFUNDS) does not exhibit predictable seasonal patterns and therefore does not require seasonal adjustment. Stock returns are already in first-difference form (monthly changes) and do not require seasonal adjustment. While stock markets may exhibit some calendar effects (such as the January effect), these are not predictable seasonal patterns in the same sense as economic time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of seasonally adjusted data ensures that regression coefficients capture underlying economic relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of seasonally adjusted data ensures that regression coefficients capture underlying economic relationships. For example, without seasonal adjustment, a spurious correlation might be observed between BNPL returns and CPI driven by holiday shopping patterns (both might increase in December), even if there is no true underlying relationship. By using seasonally adjusted CPI, the relationship is isolated between BNPL returns and underlying inflation trends, rather than seasonal price patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seasonal adjustment procedures used by FRED are transparent and well-documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seasonal adjustment procedures used by FRED are transparent and well-documented. FRED provides both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted versions of many series, allowing researchers to choose the appropriate version for their analysis. For this analysis, using seasonally adjusted data is appropriate because the focus is on underlying economic relationships rather than seasonal patterns.\n",

    "### Chart M: BNPL vs Credit Card Companies (AXP, COF, SYF) Volatility Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} chart_m_bnpl_vs_credit_card.png\n",
    ":name: chart-m\n",
    ":width: 85%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This comparison examines whether BNPL stocks exhibit volatility patterns similar to traditional consumer credit providers or represent a fundamentally different risk profile requiring distinct analytical frameworks. The analysis compares three BNPL firms against three major credit card companies, selected based on market capitalization, data availability, and business model representativeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BNPL/payments portfolio uses PayPal (PYPL), Block/Afterpay (SQ), and Affirm (AFRM) to balance depth of history with sector relevance. PayPal brings diversified payments exposure and BNPL via Pay in 4; Block acquired Afterpay in 2022, providing a direct BNPL footprint with longer public price history; Affirm remains the pure-play BNPL name. This mix provides fuller coverage from 2020 onward without over-weighting a single business model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The credit card comparators (AXP, COF, SYF) cover premium spend-centric, prime, and subprime exposures. Capital One has meaningful subprime exposure; Synchrony mirrors merchant-partnered financing; American Express is fee-heavy and premium-focused, offering a contrast to BNPL’s thin-fee model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The empirical results reveal substantial differences between BNPL and credit card company volatility profiles. BNPL stocks exhibit monthly return volatility of approximately 20.46%, more than double the 9.93% volatility observed for credit card companies. This 2.06x volatility ratio indicates that BNPL stocks experience substantially larger price swings than their traditional credit counterparts, reflecting greater uncertainty surrounding BNPL business models, regulatory outcomes, and competitive positioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several structural factors explain this volatility differential. BNPL firms operate with thin margins (often ~1% of GMV) versus card issuers’ net interest margins of 10–15%, making BNPL earnings more sensitive to cost fluctuations and competition. BNPL borrowers skew subprime (61% subprime or deep subprime; 63% hold multiple BNPL loans {cite}`CFPB2025ConsumerUse`), concentrating credit risk. Regulatory uncertainty around BNPL classification adds valuation risk that legacy card issuers (AXP, COF, SYF) have largely priced for decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation between BNPL and credit card company returns of 0.537 indicates moderate co-movement driven by common exposure to consumer credit conditions, interest rate expectations, and broader financial sector sentiment. However, the substantial volatility differential implies that BNPL carries idiosyncratic risks beyond those affecting traditional credit providers. For portfolio construction purposes, this means BNPL exposure cannot serve as a simple substitute for credit card company exposure despite both sectors operating in adjacent consumer credit market segments. The higher volatility also has implications for detecting interest rate sensitivity: when monthly returns routinely swing by 20% or more, identifying a relationship with interest rate changes that might move returns by 5-10 percentage points becomes statistically challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio.\n",

    "### Chart J: BNPL vs Fintech Lenders Volatility Comparison (SOFI, UPST, LC)\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} chart_j_bnpl_vs_fintech.png\n",
    ":name: chart-j\n",
    ":width: 85%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This comparison tests whether BNPL exhibits unique volatility characteristics or simply reflects the general risk profile of technology-enabled financial services firms. The analysis uses the same BNPL portfolio consisting of PayPal (PYPL), Block/Afterpay (SQ), and Affirm (AFRM), and compares it against three fintech lenders selected for their similar business characteristics: technology-driven underwriting, focus on underserved consumer segments, and reliance on capital markets funding rather than traditional deposit bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fintech lender comparators were chosen to represent the broader universe of technology-enabled consumer lending. SoFi Technologies operates as a diversified fintech platform offering personal loans, student loan refinancing, mortgages, and banking services. SoFi obtained a national bank charter in 2022, providing deposit funding that reduces reliance on wholesale markets and interest rate sensitivity. The company's evolution from pure lending to diversified financial services parallels PayPal's trajectory from payments to broader fintech offerings, making it a relevant comparator for understanding how business model diversification affects stock volatility and interest rate exposure. Upstart Holdings pioneered AI-driven credit underwriting, using machine learning models to assess borrower creditworthiness beyond traditional FICO scores. This technology-first approach to credit decisioning shares conceptual similarities with BNPL's alternative underwriting methods that rely on transaction data and behavioral signals rather than traditional credit bureau information. Upstart's stock experienced extreme volatility during the 2022-2023 period as rising interest rates compressed lending margins and increased funding costs, providing a natural experiment for understanding how technology-enabled lenders respond to monetary policy tightening. LendingClub Corporation operates as a digital marketplace bank connecting borrowers with investors through its lending platform. LendingClub's acquisition of Radius Bank in 2021 provided deposit funding capabilities similar to SoFi's bank charter strategy, illustrating how fintech firms adapt business models in response to funding market conditions, a challenge that BNPL providers also face as they mature beyond their initial growth phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fintech lender comparison addresses a critical analytical question: is BNPL volatility driven by BNPL-specific factors such as the unique structure of installment payments, merchant relationships, or regulatory classification as a distinct credit product, or does it reflect general characteristics shared across technology-enabled consumer lending? If BNPL volatility substantially exceeded fintech lender volatility, this would suggest BNPL-specific risks dominate investor perceptions. If volatility is similar across sectors, this would indicate that BNPL risk primarily reflects broader fintech dynamics rather than unique characteristics of the BNPL business model. All three fintech comparators share key characteristics with BNPL firms: they target consumers underserved by traditional banks, rely on technology for underwriting and customer acquisition, face regulatory scrutiny as non-traditional lenders, and experienced significant stock price volatility during the 2022-2023 interest rate tightening cycle. These shared characteristics make them appropriate benchmarks for isolating BNPL-specific versus fintech-general risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results reveal a striking finding that has important implications for interpreting the main regression analysis. BNPL and fintech lender volatility are remarkably similar, with BNPL stocks exhibiting 20.46% monthly volatility compared to 22.31% for fintech lenders, yielding a volatility ratio of 0.92x. This near-parity suggests that BNPL volatility reflects its status as a growth-stage fintech firm rather than unique BNPL-specific risks that would require distinct analytical treatment. Both sectors share common volatility drivers including reliance on technology platforms that require continuous investment and face rapid obsolescence risk, exposure to credit risk in underserved consumer segments with limited credit histories, sensitivity to funding market conditions and interest rate changes that affect cost of capital, regulatory uncertainty as authorities develop frameworks for non-traditional lending models, and investor focus on growth metrics such as user acquisition and transaction volume rather than current profitability metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation between BNPL and fintech lender returns of 0.507 indicates substantial co-movement, further supporting the view that these sectors respond to similar market forces rather than exhibiting independent risk characteristics. When risk appetite for growth-oriented financial technology firms increases, both BNPL and fintech lender stocks tend to rise together; when sentiment shifts negative due to macroeconomic concerns or sector-specific news, both sectors decline in tandem. This pattern suggests that investors view BNPL as part of the broader fintech ecosystem rather than as a distinct asset class with unique risk characteristics requiring specialized analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This volatility comparison has important implications for interpreting the main regression results presented in the data analysis section. The high baseline volatility of both BNPL and fintech lenders, approximately 20-22% monthly, creates substantial statistical noise that can obscure interest rate effects even when such effects exist economically. When monthly returns routinely swing by 20% or more based on earnings surprises, competitive developments, management guidance changes, or broader sentiment shifts, detecting a relationship with interest rate changes that might move returns by 5-10 percentage points becomes statistically challenging due to insufficient signal-to-noise ratio. The similar volatility between BNPL and fintech lenders also suggests that the difficulty in detecting BNPL interest rate sensitivity may reflect a broader pattern across the fintech sector: technology-enabled consumer lenders as a class may exhibit weak stock price sensitivity to interest rates despite having business models with direct funding cost exposure. This could occur because growth expectations, competitive dynamics, and regulatory developments dominate investor attention and drive valuation changes, overwhelming the signal from funding cost changes that affect near-term profitability. The high market beta of approximately 2.4 observed in the main regression analysis is consistent with this interpretation, as BNPL stocks behave like high-beta growth stocks that amplify market movements and respond primarily to changes in risk appetite rather than sector-specific fundamentals like funding costs or interest rate spreads.\n",
