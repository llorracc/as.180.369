## Introduction and Research Question

In fiscal year 2024, Affirm Holdings reported funding costs of $650 million, up 88% from the prior year, attributing the increase to higher benchmark rates as the Federal Reserve lifted the policy rate from near zero to above 5%. Over two years, Affirm’s funding costs rose 394%, illustrating how monetary tightening transmits directly to BNPL providers via wholesale funding (Laudenbach et al., 2025). Yet over the same period Affirm’s stock fell 70% while revenue grew 30%, raising a puzzle: if BNPL firms face clear funding cost sensitivity, do their stock returns reflect this exposure?

This paper investigates whether BNPL stock returns exhibit interest rate sensitivity consistent with firm-level funding pass-through. The question matters because BNPL scaled from $2 billion in GMV in 2019 to a projected $560 billion by 2025 {cite}`CFPB2022MarketTrends` {cite}`Chargeflow2025`. If BNPL stocks respond to monetary policy, that affects portfolio construction, risk management, and oversight. If they do not, despite clear firm-level sensitivity, it reveals how investors value fintech and whether BNPL sits outside traditional monetary transmission.

Using 66 monthly returns (February 2020–August 2025) for three publicly traded BNPL providers, I find high market beta (2.38) but no statistically significant rate sensitivity. A one percentage point rise in the Federal Funds Rate associates with ~13% lower BNPL returns (β = -12.89), economically large but statistically imprecise (p = 0.197) given high volatility and limited power. Market movements explain 52% of BNPL return variation versus 2% for rates, indicating that investors price BNPL as high-beta growth assets rather than rate-sensitive financials (Fama & French, 1993).

The following section reviews literature on (i) interest rate sensitivity of financial stocks, (ii) asset pricing of growth firms, and (iii) BNPL-specific evidence on funding structures and consumer behavior, to frame the empirical analysis and highlight the gap this study fills.
