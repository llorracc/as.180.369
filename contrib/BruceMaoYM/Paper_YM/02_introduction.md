## Introduction and Research Question

This paper quantifies the interest rate sensitivity of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) stock returns and compares it to benchmarks from traditional financial institutions. Using monthly return data from February 2020 to August 2025 for three publicly traded BNPL providers, I estimate rate sensitivity coefficients and compare them to credit card issuers using identical specifications. I find that BNPL stocks exhibit economically large but statistically insignificant (imprecisely estimated) rate sensitivity (β = -12.89, SE = 9.99, p = 0.197), with high market beta (approximately 2.4) dominating return variation. The benchmark comparison reveals that credit card issuers also exhibit statistically weak rate sensitivity in monthly data, suggesting that detecting rate sensitivity in stock returns may be challenging even for rate-sensitive sectors.

### Research Question and Theoretical Framework

The relationship between interest rates and BNPL stock returns operates through multiple channels with potentially offsetting effects. A simple valuation framework clarifies these mechanisms:

$$Stock\ Price = \sum_t \frac{E[Cash\ Flow_t]}{(1 + r + risk\ premium)^t}$$

An interest rate increase affects stock prices through two primary channels. First, the **cash flow channel** operates through funding costs: higher rates increase BNPL firms' funding costs (warehouse facilities, securitization), reducing expected cash flows. However, this effect may be offset if firms pass costs to merchants and consumers (Laudenbach et al. 2025 document 80-100% pass-through), or if higher credit card rates increase BNPL demand through competitive substitution. Second, the **discount rate channel** operates through valuation: higher risk-free rates increase the discount rate, reducing the present value of future cash flows. For growth-stage firms with long-duration cash flows, this channel can be substantial.

The net effect captured by the regression coefficient combines these offsetting channels. The direct funding cost channel predicts negative sensitivity, while competitive substitution predicts positive sensitivity. The discount rate channel predicts negative sensitivity, particularly for growth firms. Without a structural model that quantifies each channel, the regression captures the net effect, which may be small if channels offset.

### Distinguishing Firm-Level and Stock-Level Sensitivity

A critical distinction separates firm-level funding cost sensitivity from stock return sensitivity. Firm-level evidence shows Affirm's funding costs increased 394% from FY2022 to FY2024, but this increase reflects both volume growth (more loans) and rate effects (higher rates on the same volume). Stock return sensitivity depends on whether investors anticipated these costs, whether firms can pass costs through, and whether growth expectations dominate valuation. A firm can have high funding cost sensitivity but low stock return sensitivity if investors anticipated rate increases and priced them in before they materialized, if firms pass costs to merchants and consumers, or if growth expectations dominate current profitability in valuation.

### Research Hypotheses

I test three hypotheses. First, BNPL stock returns exhibit negative sensitivity to interest rate increases (H1). This hypothesis posits that β < 0 for the interest rate coefficient, reflecting net negative effects of funding costs and discount rates outweighing any positive competitive substitution effects. Second, BNPL rate sensitivity is comparable in magnitude to traditional financial stocks (H2). This hypothesis posits that |β_BNPL - β_Financials| is statistically indistinguishable from zero when estimated using identical specifications over the same time period. Third, BNPL rate sensitivity is statistically weak in monthly return data, with high market beta dominating return variation (H3). This hypothesis posits that β_BNPL is statistically insignificant (p > 0.15) while market beta > 2.0 and R²_market >> R²_rates, consistent with growth-oriented asset pricing.

### Motivation and Context

In fiscal year 2024, Affirm Holdings reported funding costs of $344.3 million (Affirm 10-K, 2024), up 88% from the prior year, attributing the increase to higher benchmark rates as the Federal Reserve lifted the policy rate from near zero to above 5%. Over two years (FY2022 to FY2024), Affirm's funding costs increased by 394% (from $69.7 million to $344.3 million), but this increase reflects both volume growth and rate effects. Without decomposing these effects, the 394% increase may overstate pure rate sensitivity. Moreover, Laudenbach et al. (2025) document that BNPL firms pass 80-100% of funding cost increases to consumer rates and merchant fees, suggesting that funding cost increases may be profit-neutral if firms maintain pricing power.

The relationship between firm-level funding costs and stock returns is theoretically ambiguous. For growth-stage firms with negative operating margins, current funding costs may be economically irrelevant if investors believe the firm will achieve scale, diversify funding sources, or pass costs through. Stock prices reflect expectations about future profitability, not just current conditions. If investors anticipated interest rate increases and incorporated them into prices before they materialized (the Fed's tightening cycle was heavily telegraphed starting in late 2021), then realized monthly rate changes may have minimal impact because they were already priced in.

### Empirical Approach

This investigation quantifies BNPL stock return sensitivity to interest rate changes and compares it to benchmarks from credit card issuers (American Express, Capital One, Synchrony Financial) using identical regression specifications. I estimate rate sensitivity coefficients for both BNPL and credit card issuers, allowing direct comparison of magnitudes and statistical precision. This benchmark comparison is essential because without establishing what "rate-sensitive financial institution" behavior looks like quantitatively, claims about BNPL behaving "differently" are untestable. Using 66 monthly return observations spanning February 2020 to August 2025, I estimate multiple specifications including base OLS, full OLS with controls, Fama-French three-factor models, instrumental variables, and difference-in-differences approaches to assess robustness.

The following section reviews literature on (i) interest rate sensitivity of financial stocks, (ii) asset pricing of growth firms, and (iii) BNPL-specific evidence on funding structures and consumer behavior, to frame the empirical analysis and highlight the gap this study fills.
