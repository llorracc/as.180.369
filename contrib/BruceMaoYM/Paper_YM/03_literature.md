## Literature Review: BNPL Market Dynamics and Interest Rate Sensitivity

This section reviews existing academic and empirical literature on Buy Now, Pay Later firms, focusing on findings that inform understanding of BNPL sensitivity to monetary policy changes. The literature spans consumer spending patterns, credit market dynamics, firm-level funding structures, and interest rate transmission mechanisms. A critical gap exists in this literature: while extensive research examines BNPL adoption, consumer behavior, and market growth, relatively little empirical work directly links BNPL firm performance to monetary policy changes through stock return analysis. This gap motivates the present empirical analysis, which seeks to quantify BNPL firms' interest rate sensitivity using stock return data while controlling for confounding factors.

Interest rate sensitivity in the BNPL context refers to the responsiveness of BNPL firms' stock returns, profitability, and business operations to changes in benchmark interest rates that affect their cost of capital through wholesale funding markets. This sensitivity operates primarily through three channels. The first channel involves direct funding cost pass-through, where increases in benchmark rates raise BNPL providers' borrowing costs from warehouse facilities, securitization markets, and commercial paper markets. The second channel involves competitive substitution effects, where higher interest rates on credit cards and personal loans may increase consumer demand for BNPL products that charge no interest to consumers. The third channel involves capital market access, where rising rates affect investor expectations and BNPL firms' ability to raise equity and debt capital.

Research on consumer spending patterns provides foundational context for understanding BNPL market dynamics. Di Maggio, Williams, and Katz utilize transaction-level data to analyze BNPL user demographics and spending behaviors, finding that BNPL access increases total spending by approximately USD 130 per week with effects persisting for 24 weeks, suggesting a liquidity effect beyond standard substitution models {cite}`DiMaggio2022`. This spending response motivates the inclusion of consumer confidence as a control variable in regression analysis, as BNPL transaction volumes and firm revenues depend on consumer willingness to spend. Bian, Cong, and Ji examine the integration of BNPL services within digital wallets, documenting that BNPL has greatly expanded credit access especially to underserved consumers, with BNPL boosting consumption by 15 to 20% and correlating positively with consumer confidence {cite}`Bian2023`. Their finding that a one-standard-deviation increase in consumer confidence is associated with approximately 8 to 12% increase in BNPL transaction volume further justifies including consumer confidence measures in the regression framework.

The literature on BNPL's effects on consumer financial health reveals important patterns relevant to understanding firm-level risk. deHaan, Kim, Lourie, and Zhu investigate the impact of BNPL on consumers' financial health in their Management Science article, finding that new BNPL users experience rapid increases in overdraft charges and credit card interest and fees, suggesting potential negative welfare implications and indicating that BNPL users may be financially fragile {cite}`deHaan2024`. Guttman-Kenney, Firth, and Gathergood examine the phenomenon of consumers charging BNPL transactions to their credit cards, highlighting concerns about over-indebtedness especially among younger consumers and those in deprived areas {cite}`GuttmanKenney2023`. These findings suggest that BNPL firms' customer bases may be particularly vulnerable to economic shocks, amplifying the potential for credit losses during monetary tightening cycles.

Research on credit market conditions and BNPL profitability directly informs expectations about interest rate sensitivity. Laudenbach and colleagues demonstrate that BNPL firms operate with thin profit margins of approximately 1% and that funding costs increase by 0.8 to 1.0 percentage points for each percentage point increase in benchmark rates, indicating near-complete pass-through of monetary policy changes {cite}`Laudenbach2025`. Given profit margins of approximately 1%, a single percentage point rate increase can eliminate profitability entirely. Their finding that BNPL customers pay approximately 1.4 percentage points less interest than comparable borrowers, representing a 15% reduction in interest rates, demonstrates the thin margins on which BNPL firms operate. The Bank for International Settlements working paper on fintech credit discusses the implications of BNPL services on credit reporting and the potential risks of overborrowing due to the lack of information sharing among fintech lenders, highlighting systemic risks that could materialize during periods of monetary tightening {cite}`BIS2025`.

Berg, Burg, Keil, and Puri examine BNPL from the merchant perspective in their Journal of Financial Economics article, finding that BNPL serves as a price discrimination mechanism that increases merchant sales by approximately 20%, with effects on low-creditworthiness customers two to three times larger than on high-creditworthiness customers {cite}`Berg2025`. Industry data corroborates these findings, with surveys indicating that more than half of merchants report increased conversion rates and brand awareness after implementing BNPL options {cite}`PYMNTS2022`. This concentration of BNPL benefits among low-creditworthiness consumers has implications for understanding how economic conditions affect BNPL demand and default risk. The Economics Letters study on factors affecting BNPL demand identifies that BNPL is more popular among younger, lower-income individuals and that demand is negatively associated with interest rates, providing direct evidence of the interest rate channel {cite}`EconLetters2024`. Recent reporting documents that BNPL borrowers tend to use these services for everyday purchases including groceries and household items rather than solely for large discretionary purchases, suggesting that BNPL has become integrated into routine consumer spending patterns {cite}`Reuters2024`.

Research on consumer credit characteristics reveals the financial vulnerability of BNPL borrowers. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York analyze BNPL user demographics and find that users are disproportionately young, have lower incomes, and face greater financial constraints than non-users, with BNPL serving as a mechanism for consumption smoothing among liquidity-constrained households {cite}`NYFed2023BNPL`. Their subsequent research examines the motivations behind BNPL usage, finding that consumers primarily adopt these services to manage cash flow and avoid credit card interest, suggesting that BNPL demand responds to broader credit market conditions {cite}`NYFed2024BNPL`. Hayashi and Routh find that financial constraints drive BNPL usage, with high correlation between BNPL late payments and financial vulnerability, suggesting that economic conditions affecting household liquidity directly impact BNPL demand {cite}`Hayashi2024`. The Central Bank of Ireland study analyzes the financial vulnerability of BNPL users, finding a high correlation between late payments and financial distress, suggesting that BNPL may lead to overspending among certain consumers {cite}`CBI2024`. The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond documents that financially fragile consumers are almost three times more likely to have repeated BNPL use, further indicating vulnerability to economic conditions {cite}`FedRichmond2024`. These patterns of financial fragility among BNPL users suggest that the sector may be particularly vulnerable to monetary policy tightening, as rate increases could exacerbate repayment difficulties among already-stressed borrowers.

The Journal of Retailing study employs a synthetic difference-in-differences design to assess how BNPL adoption influences online spending, finding a 6.42% increase in order size among BNPL users with notable variations across customer segments and product categories {cite}`JRetailing2024`. Cheng and Huo examine BNPL adoption through a game-theoretic lens focusing on time-inconsistent consumer behavior, highlighting how BNPL can mitigate the negative effects of time inconsistency on pricing, demand, and profit {cite}`ChengHuo2025`. Brewer and Arber assess consumer understanding of financial risks associated with BNPL services, finding that most users struggled to comprehend key loan terms, indicating a need for better consumer education and potential regulatory intervention that could affect BNPL business models {cite}`BrewerArber2025`.

The literature establishes several mechanisms through which BNPL firms may be sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, informing the empirical analysis and motivating specific control variables. The strong theoretical motivation for expecting negative relationships between Federal Funds Rate changes and BNPL stock returns comes from the combination of near-complete funding cost pass-through documented by Laudenbach et al., thin profit margins of approximately 1%, and concentration of BNPL usage among financially vulnerable consumers. Based on theoretical predictions and observed valuation patterns such as Klarna's 85% decline during the 2022-2023 tightening cycle, the expected coefficient magnitude is approximately negative 10 to 15, indicating that a percentage point rate increase would be associated with a 10 to 15% decline in BNPL stock returns. The regression framework employs a log-linear specification estimated in two stages: a base model with only interest rate changes, followed by a full model adding consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation, and market returns as controls. This approach isolates the interest rate effect while assessing the incremental explanatory power of additional variables that the literature identifies as relevant to BNPL firm performance.

The literature review establishes that BNPL firms face direct funding cost pass-through and serve financially fragile consumers, creating theoretical conditions for negative rate sensitivity. The next section presents data, methodology, and empirical results that test these predictions.
