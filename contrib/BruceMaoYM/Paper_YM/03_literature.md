## Literature Review: BNPL Market Dynamics and Interest Rate Sensitivity

This section reviews the existing academic and empirical literature on Buy-Now-Pay-Later firms, focusing on findings that inform the understanding of BNPL firms' sensitivity to monetary policy changes. Before proceeding, this study defines what is meant by "interest-rate sensitivity" in the context of BNPL firms: the responsiveness of BNPL firms' stock returns, profitability, and business operations to changes in benchmark interest rates (specifically, the Federal Funds Rate) that affect their cost of capital through wholesale funding markets. This sensitivity operates primarily through three channels: (1) direct funding cost pass-through, where increases in benchmark rates raise BNPL providers' borrowing costs from warehouse facilities, securitization markets, and commercial paper markets; (2) competitive substitution effects, where higher interest rates on credit cards and personal loans increase consumer demand for BNPL products; and (3) capital market access, where rising rates affect investor expectations and BNPL firms' ability to raise capital.

The literature spans multiple dimensions: consumer spending patterns, credit market dynamics, firm-level funding structures, and interest rate transmission mechanisms. However, a critical gap exists: while extensive research examines BNPL adoption, consumer behavior, and market growth, relatively little empirical work directly links BNPL firm performance to monetary policy changes through stock return analysis. This gap motivates this empirical analysis, which seeks to quantify BNPL firms' interest-rate sensitivity using stock return data while controlling for confounding factors.

Traditional credit theory, rooted in the Modigliani-Miller framework and extended by Stiglitz-Weiss models of credit rationing, predicts that all forms of consumer credit should show negative sensitivity to interest rates. Higher rates increase the cost of capital, reduce present value of future cash flows, and tighten credit availability. This theoretical prediction applies particularly strongly to BNPL firms, which rely on wholesale funding and operate with thin profit margins. However, the null finding challenges these foundational assumptions. The study hypothesizes that BNPL firms exhibit minimal interest rate sensitivity for three reasons: (1) revenue model independence, unlike traditional lenders who profit from interest rate spreads, BNPL firms earn merchant fees per transaction (typically 4-8% of transaction value) that are independent of interest rates; (2) duration mismatch elimination, with average loan durations of 6-8 weeks, BNPL avoids the asset-liability mismatches that make banks rate-sensitive; and (3) customer segmentation, BNPL targets consumers who may be less rate-elastic than subprime borrowers served by traditional high-cost credit, though evidence on this point is mixed.

### Consumer Spending Patterns and BNPL Adoption

{cite}`DiMaggio2022` find that BNPL access increases spending by approximately USD 130 per week with 24-week persistence, motivating consumer confidence as a control variable. {cite}`Bian2023` find that BNPL boosts consumption 15-20% and correlates with consumer confidence (8-12% increase in transaction volume per one-standard-deviation increase in confidence), further justifying consumer confidence controls. {cite}`Gathergood2019` document balance-matching behavior among credit card users, providing context for understanding consumer credit decision-making patterns that may extend to BNPL usage.

### Credit Market Conditions and BNPL Profitability

{cite}`Laudenbach2025` demonstrate that BNPL firms operate with thin profit margins (~1%) and that funding costs increase by 0.8-1.0 percentage points for each percentage point increase in benchmark rates, indicating near-complete pass-through of monetary policy changes. The {cite}`CFPB2022MarketTrends` documents that net transaction margins declined from 1.27% in 2020 to 1.01% in 2021, providing direct evidence of thin margins that amplify sensitivity to cost increases. {cite}`Buchak2018` document that shadow banks' funding structures create greater sensitivity to market conditions compared to traditional banks, supporting the theoretical prediction that BNPL firms exhibit heightened interest rate sensitivity. {cite}`Berg2025` examine BNPL from the merchant perspective, finding that BNPL serves as a price discrimination mechanism that increases merchant revenue, which may affect BNPL firms' profitability and market valuation.

### Consumer Credit Characteristics and Financial Vulnerability

The {cite}`CFPB2023ConsumerUse` finds that BNPL borrowers have subprime credit scores (580-669), higher credit card utilization rates (60-66%), and are more likely to revolve on credit cards (69%), indicating financial vulnerability that amplifies sensitivity to economic shocks. The {cite}`FedRichmond2024` finds that financially fragile consumers are almost three times more likely to have repeated BNPL use, further indicating vulnerability to economic conditions. {cite}`Hayashi2024` find that financial constraints drive BNPL usage, suggesting that economic conditions affecting household liquidity directly impact BNPL demand. {cite}`Powell2023` examine BNPL user behavior in Australia, finding that responsible financial behaviors correlate with BNPL usage patterns, providing cross-country evidence on BNPL consumer characteristics.

### Interest Rate Sensitivity and Funding Structure

{cite}`Flannery1984` provide the theoretical framework for understanding financial institutions' interest rate sensitivity, documenting that institutions with asset-liability maturity mismatches exhibit significant sensitivity to rate movements. This framework applies directly to BNPL firms: their reliance on short-term wholesale funding combined with longer-maturity loan portfolios creates the duration mismatch that amplifies interest rate sensitivity. Affirm Holdings' 10-K filings document that funding costs increased dramatically during the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle (see Appendix A.1 for detailed analysis), providing firm-level evidence of the direct pass-through mechanism. {cite}`Berg2020` demonstrate that digital footprints enable alternative credit scoring for fintech lenders, which may affect BNPL firms' risk assessment capabilities and funding costs. {cite}`Johnson2021` analyze regulatory frameworks for BNPL, highlighting regulatory uncertainty as a potential source of volatility in BNPL stock returns.

## Firm-Level Context

Firm-level financial analysis of Affirm Holdings Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. 10-K filings from 2021-2024 is presented in Appendix A.1, which examines funding structures, loan portfolios, revenue growth relative to funding costs, and implications for sector-wide sensitivity patterns.

## Bridge to Empirical Analysis: Literature-Informed Hypotheses

The literature review above establishes several key mechanisms through which BNPL firms may be sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, particularly monetary policy changes. These mechanisms inform the empirical analysis and motivate the inclusion of specific control variables in the regression framework.

The literature provides strong theoretical motivation for expecting negative relationships between Federal Funds Rate changes and BNPL stock returns. {cite}`Laudenbach2025` find that BNPL firms' funding costs increase by approximately 0.8-1.0 percentage points for each percentage point increase in benchmark interest rates, indicating near-complete pass-through of monetary policy changes to funding costs. Combined with thin profit margins (approximately 1% net transaction margins per {cite}`CFPB2022MarketTrends`) and high leverage, these findings indicate that interest rate increases compress profit margins and reduce profitability, which should be reflected in negative stock returns.

{cite}`Bian2023` find that a one-standard-deviation increase in consumer confidence is associated with approximately 8-12% increase in BNPL transaction volume. {cite}`DiMaggio2022` find that BNPL access increases spending with 24-week persistence. These findings justify including consumer confidence measures in the regression analysis.

The {cite}`CFPB2022MakingEndsMeet` finds that income variability increased sharply from 2021 to 2022, with 37% of households unable to cover expenses for more than one month if income were lost. This indicates that changes in household financial conditions affect BNPL demand, motivating the inclusion of disposable income measures.

Standard asset pricing theory suggests that BNPL stock returns should be correlated with market returns through systematic risk factors. Inflation may affect BNPL firms through multiple channels: its impact on consumer purchasing power, its effect on funding costs, and its influence on economic uncertainty. These variables are included as controls to isolate the effect of interest rate changes while accounting for broader market movements and macroeconomic conditions.

The regression framework employs a log-linear specification estimated in two stages: a base model with only interest rate changes, followed by a full model adding consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation, and market returns as controls. This approach isolates the interest rate effect while assessing the incremental explanatory power of additional variables.
