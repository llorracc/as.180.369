## 2. Literature Review: BNPL Market Dynamics and Interest Rate Sensitivity

This section reviews the existing academic and empirical literature on Buy-Now-Pay-Later firms, focusing on findings that inform my understanding of BNPL firms' sensitivity to monetary policy changes. Before proceeding, I define what I mean by "interest-rate sensitivity" in the context of BNPL firms: the responsiveness of BNPL firms' stock returns, profitability, and business operations to changes in benchmark interest rates (specifically, the Federal Funds Rate) that affect their cost of capital through wholesale funding markets. This sensitivity operates primarily through three channels: (1) direct funding cost pass-through, where increases in benchmark rates raise BNPL providers' borrowing costs from warehouse facilities, securitization markets, and commercial paper markets; (2) competitive substitution effects, where higher interest rates on credit cards and personal loans increase consumer demand for BNPL products; and (3) capital market access, where rising rates affect investor expectations and BNPL firms' ability to raise capital. This definition distinguishes BNPL interest-rate sensitivity from traditional consumer credit products, recognizing that many BNPL products are interest-free for consumers (if paid on time) and funded primarily through merchant fees and provider borrowing costs rather than consumer interest charges.

The literature spans multiple dimensions: consumer spending patterns, credit market dynamics, firm-level funding structures, and interest rate transmission mechanisms. However, a critical gap exists: while extensive research examines BNPL adoption, consumer behavior, and market growth, relatively little empirical work directly links BNPL firm performance to monetary policy changes through stock return analysis. This gap motivates my empirical analysis, which seeks to quantify BNPL firms' interest-rate sensitivity using stock return data while controlling for confounding factors.

Traditional credit theory, rooted in the Modigliani-Miller framework and extended by Stiglitz-Weiss models of credit rationing, predicts that all forms of consumer credit should show negative sensitivity to interest rates. Higher rates increase the cost of capital, reduce present value of future cash flows, and tighten credit availability. This theoretical prediction applies particularly strongly to BNPL firms, which rely on wholesale funding and operate with thin profit margins. However, my null finding challenges these foundational assumptions. I hypothesize that BNPL firms exhibit minimal interest rate sensitivity for three reasons: (1) revenue model independence—unlike traditional lenders who profit from interest rate spreads, BNPL firms earn merchant fees per transaction (typically 4-8% of transaction value) that are independent of interest rates; (2) duration mismatch elimination—with average loan durations of 6-8 weeks, BNPL avoids the asset-liability mismatches that make banks rate-sensitive; and (3) customer segmentation—BNPL targets consumers who may be less rate-elastic than subprime borrowers served by traditional high-cost credit, though evidence on this point is mixed. This theoretical framework motivates my empirical analysis, which tests whether BNPL operates outside traditional monetary policy transmission channels.

### 2.1 Consumer Spending Patterns and BNPL Adoption

Di Maggio, Williams, and Katz (2022) analyze how BNPL access affects consumer spending behavior using transaction-level data from major BNPL providers covering millions of transactions. They find that BNPL access increases total spending by approximately $130 per week on average. This substantial increase demonstrates that BNPL functions not merely as a payment method but as a mechanism that facilitates additional consumption. The authors identify what they term a "liquidity flypaper effect," whereby BNPL liquidity drives additional same-category expenditure. Consumers who gain access to BNPL tend to increase spending within the same product categories rather than simply shifting spending across categories.

Most importantly for understanding BNPL firms' sensitivity to economic conditions, Di Maggio et al. show that spending remains elevated for 24 weeks after first BNPL use. This persistence creates sustained revenue streams for BNPL providers. The 24-week persistence effect demonstrates that consumer spending variables, particularly measures of consumer confidence and disposable income, predict BNPL stock returns. Changes in aggregate consumer spending directly affect BNPL transaction volumes and revenue. The persistent 24-week spending effect implies that BNPL firms' revenue streams exhibit some stability, but consumer sentiment and economic conditions also play crucial roles in determining BNPL demand. This creates a channel through which macroeconomic variables affect BNPL stock performance.

Di Maggio et al. also find that BNPL usage is concentrated among consumers with moderate to high credit scores (680-740), suggesting that BNPL serves consumers who have credit capacity but prefer BNPL's payment structure over traditional credit cards. This finding contradicts evidence from other sources (discussed below) that BNPL users have lower credit scores. For this analysis, I rely on the CFPB's characterization (subprime borrowers with high utilization) for three reasons: (1) the CFPB uses comprehensive credit bureau data covering all major BNPL providers, (2) their sample is more recent (2022-2023), and (3) subprime borrower characteristics are more consistent with the high default rates documented across multiple sources. This characterization strengthens the theoretical prediction that BNPL firms are sensitive to economic conditions, as financially constrained borrowers reduce spending and increase defaults when interest rates rise.

Gathergood et al. (2019) examine how consumers manage multiple debt obligations using data on 1.4 million individuals in the United Kingdom over a two-year period. They document that individuals allocate only 51.5% of their excess payments to the high APR card, behavior that is virtually indistinguishable from a completely non-responsive baseline (50%). To minimize interest charges, individuals should allocate 97.1% of excess payments to the high APR card, yet only 10% of individuals put 100% of their excess payments on the high interest rate card (when 85% should do so). Critically, the degree of misallocation is invariant to the difference in interest rates across cards (which can be as large as 15 percentage points), the size of the repayment amount, and the time since account opening, suggesting that optimization frictions or learning cannot explain the observed behavior. Instead, Gathergood et al. find that balance matching—whereby the share of repayments on each card matches the share of balances on each card—captures more than half of the predictable variation in repayment behavior and is the best fit model for roughly half of observations. This behavioral pattern has implications for understanding BNPL loan stacking behavior. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau documents that 63% of BNPL borrowers originated multiple simultaneous loans in 2022, and 33% held loans across multiple BNPL providers (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, "Consumer Use"). The balance-matching behavior documented by Gathergood et al. suggests that consumers facing multiple debt obligations may be vulnerable to broader economic shocks that affect their ability to manage repayments.

Bian, Cong, and Ji (2023) analyze BNPL's role in payment competition and credit expansion using transaction data from e-commerce platforms. They find that BNPL significantly boosts consumption, contributing to credit expansion beyond what traditional credit cards provide. BNPL users increase total spending by approximately 15-20% compared to non-users. BNPL also dominates e-wallet transactions, accounting for over half of such transactions. This demonstrates BNPL's substantial market share in digital payment ecosystems and establishes that BNPL firms' performance is closely tied to e-commerce growth.

Bian et al. also show complementarity between BNPL and credit cards for small-value transactions. BNPL does not simply replace credit cards but expands the overall credit market. This demonstrates that BNPL firms benefit from broader credit availability even as they compete with traditional credit providers. Most relevant for my empirical analysis, they find that BNPL adoption is driven by consumer behavior and spending decisions. Higher consumer confidence leads to more discretionary spending via BNPL. A one-standard-deviation increase in consumer confidence is associated with approximately 8-12% increase in BNPL transaction volume. This demonstrates that consumer sentiment variables predict BNPL stock returns and motivates including consumer confidence measures in my regression analysis. Consumer sentiment represents an important channel through which macroeconomic conditions affect BNPL firm performance.

### 2.2 Credit Market Conditions and BNPL Profitability

Having examined demand-side factors (consumer spending patterns and adoption), I now turn to supply-side considerations: how BNPL firms' credit assessment and profitability structures affect their sensitivity to interest rate changes. BNPL firms' business models and funding structures determine how interest rate changes translate into profitability impacts, which ultimately affect stock returns.

Laudenbach et al. (2025) demonstrate that BNPL firms operate with thin profit margins, offering consumers 1.4 percentage point interest rate discounts compared to traditional credit products. Critically, they document that BNPL firms' funding costs increase by 0.8-1.0 percentage points for each percentage point increase in benchmark rates, indicating near-complete pass-through of monetary policy changes.

These findings provide strong theoretical support for expecting BNPL stock returns to respond negatively to interest rate increases. Funding cost increases directly compress profit margins and reduce profitability, which should be reflected in stock returns.

Laudenbach et al. also show that BNPL firms benefit from private information about borrower repayment behavior that is not available to traditional lenders. BNPL customers pay approximately 1.4 percentage points less interest than comparable borrowers, representing a 15% reduction in interest rates. BNPL customers' internal credit scores improve by 8-10 points, and BNPL customers with three or more transactions are approximately 30 percentage points more likely to be approved for bank loans compared to similar non-BNPL customers. This demonstrates that BNPL serves as a credit-building mechanism.

While Laudenbach et al.'s analysis focuses on European markets using proprietary data from a single European bank partnership, limiting generalizability to U.S. BNPL firms, the fundamental mechanism—thin margins combined with wholesale funding dependence—applies broadly across BNPL business models. My analysis addresses this limitation by examining U.S. publicly traded BNPL firms directly through stock return data.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Market Trends Report (2022) provides evidence on BNPL firms' profitability and cost structure using data from five major BNPL providers covering approximately 80% of the U.S. BNPL market. The report's quantitative findings inform my understanding of BNPL firms' vulnerability to interest rate changes.

Buchak et al. (2018) document the rapid growth of fintech and shadow bank lenders, showing that shadow banks' market share in mortgage origination nearly doubled from roughly 30% in 2007 to 50% in 2015. This growth has been particularly robust in markets serving less creditworthy borrowers, with shadow banks holding 75% market share in the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) market in 2015. An important segment of this growth were fintech lenders that primarily originate mortgages online, which expanded rapidly since 2007 and accounted for a quarter of shadow bank origination in 2015. This growth pattern, driven by regulatory arbitrage and technological advantages, is consistent with BNPL's rapid expansion. Importantly, Buchak et al. note that shadow banks' funding structures create greater sensitivity to market conditions and funding cost changes compared to traditional banks with deposit funding, supporting the theoretical prediction that BNPL firms exhibit heightened interest rate sensitivity.

The report documents that net transaction margins declined from 1.27% in 2020 to 1.01% in 2021, representing a 20% decline in profitability margins over a single year. This margin compression occurred alongside increases in credit loss provisions, which rose from 1.15% in 2020 to 1.30% in 2021, representing a 13% increase in credit losses. Merchant discount fees also declined, falling from 2.91% in 2020 to 2.49% in 2021, representing a 14% decline that reflects competitive pressures in merchant acquisition.

Most relevant for my empirical analysis, the report notes that cost of funds increased in early-to-mid 2022, though this period falls outside the primary survey window. This indicates that the margin compression documented in 2020-2021 worsened as interest rates increased. These findings provide direct evidence that BNPL firms operate with extremely thin margins (approximately 1% net transaction margins), making them vulnerable to cost increases.

The combination of declining transaction margins, increasing credit losses, and rising funding costs demonstrates that BNPL firms face substantial pressure on profitability, which is reflected in stock returns. The 20% margin decline over a single year, combined with the documented increase in funding costs, provides quantitative evidence supporting my hypothesis that BNPL stock returns should respond negatively to interest rate increases. Given these thin margins, small increases in funding costs can substantially impact profitability.

Research examining BNPL from the merchant perspective provides additional insights into the competitive dynamics and pricing pressures that affect BNPL firms' profitability. Berg et al. (2025) examine BNPL from the merchant's perspective, arguing that BNPL functions as a price-discrimination mechanism that allows merchants to offer effectively lower prices to low-creditworthiness customers. They confirm that making BNPL available increases merchant sales by 20%, with effects at the extensive margin accounting for 60-70% of the total effect. Critically, offering BNPL to low-creditworthiness customers has greater effects on sales than offers to any other group: purchases of low-creditworthiness customers are two to three times as responsive as purchases of high-creditworthiness customers. The benefits of offering BNPL significantly outweigh the costs for merchants, explaining the rapid adoption of BNPL in e-commerce. This merchant-side evidence complements the consumer-side findings of Di Maggio et al. (2022) and provides important context for understanding BNPL firms' business models and revenue streams. The finding that BNPL is particularly effective for low-creditworthiness customers suggests that BNPL firms' revenue (merchant discount fees) may be vulnerable to competitive pressures that reduce merchant market power.

Merchants' adoption decisions and fee negotiations directly impact BNPL firms' revenue streams. BNPL providers compete for merchant partnerships while maintaining profitability. The decline in merchant discount fees documented in the CFPB Market Trends Report reflects competitive pressures in merchant acquisition. This demonstrates that BNPL firms have limited ability to pass funding cost increases to merchants, particularly in competitive markets. This constraint on pricing flexibility amplifies BNPL firms' sensitivity to interest rate changes. They cannot easily adjust merchant fees to offset rising funding costs.

The broader fintech literature provides context for understanding how alternative financial service providers respond to macroeconomic conditions. Research on BNPL regulation and consumer financial behavior offers additional insights into how BNPL firms operate and respond to economic conditions.

### 2.3 Consumer Credit Characteristics and Financial Vulnerability

While sections 2.1 and 2.2 examined aggregate spending patterns and firm-level profitability structures, understanding the characteristics of BNPL borrowers themselves provides crucial microeconomic foundations for predicting how economic conditions affect BNPL firms. The credit profile and financial vulnerability of BNPL users determine default risk, repayment capacity, and sensitivity to economic shocks, all of which directly affect BNPL firms' profitability and stock performance. However, the literature reveals a notable contradiction regarding BNPL users' credit profiles that warrants critical examination. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Consumer Use Report (2023) analyzes the demographic and credit profile of BNPL borrowers. The report finds that BNPL borrowers have subprime credit scores (580-669) compared to non-users (670-739). This indicates that BNPL serves consumers with lower credit quality. This finding contradicts Di Maggio et al.'s (2022) finding that BNPL usage is concentrated among consumers with moderate to high credit scores (680-740). This contradiction reflects several factors: different data sources (transaction-level provider data versus credit bureau data), different time periods, or different definitions of BNPL users (first-time users versus repeat users). The CFPB report's use of credit bureau data may capture a broader population of BNPL users, including those who use BNPL infrequently or have limited credit histories, while Di Maggio et al.'s transaction-level data may focus on more active BNPL users. This methodological difference highlights the importance of understanding data sources and sample selection when interpreting findings across studies.

The CFPB report finds that BNPL borrowers exhibit higher credit card utilization rates (60-66% versus 34% for non-BNPL users) and are more likely to revolve on credit cards (69% versus 42%). The high credit card utilization rates (60-66%) documented by the CFPB suggest that BNPL users carry substantial existing debt burdens, limiting their capacity to absorb additional costs. Research on BNPL and financial wellbeing demonstrates that BNPL usage patterns are associated with financial vulnerability and stress, with high utilization rates predicting financial distress.

Agarwal et al. (2009) document that financial decision-making quality varies systematically over the lifecycle, with younger consumers demonstrating higher rates of suboptimal borrowing and debt management behavior. Given that BNPL users skew younger and have limited credit experience, this suggests that the BNPL customer base may be particularly prone to overextension. This demographic concentration amplifies BNPL firms' credit risk exposure during economic stress periods.

Berg et al. (2020) examine how fintech lenders use digital footprints and alternative data for credit assessment using more than 250,000 observations from an E-commerce company in Germany. They find that digital footprint variables equal or exceed the information content of credit bureau scores: the area under the curve (AUC) using digital footprint variables alone is 69.6%, higher than the AUC using credit bureau score alone (68.3%). When combined, the digital footprint and credit bureau score achieve an AUC of 73.6%, representing a 5.3 percentage point improvement over the credit bureau score alone. The correlation between digital footprint-based scores and credit bureau scores is approximately 10%, indicating that digital footprints complement rather than substitute for traditional credit information. Critically, Berg et al. show that the discriminatory power of digital footprints for unscorable customers (those without credit bureau scores) matches that for scorable customers (72.2% versus 69.6% in-sample, 68.8% versus 68.3% out-of-sample), demonstrating that digital footprints can facilitate credit access for borrowers with limited traditional credit histories. This finding suggests that BNPL firms' informational advantages, documented by Laudenbach et al. (2025), may be particularly valuable for serving consumers who lack traditional credit records, though the effectiveness of these models during periods of macroeconomic stress remains an open question.

Powell et al. (2023) examine the relationship between responsible financial behaviors and financial wellbeing among BNPL users using a survey of 360 BNPL users in Australia and structural equation modeling. They find that thorough examination of BNPL terms and conditions has the largest coefficient (0.40) and highest significance on financial wellbeing, followed by planning and budgeting (coefficient 0.23, significant at 1% level). Lower compulsive buying also has a significantly positive impact on financial wellbeing (coefficient 0.11), with impulse buying influencing compulsive buying (coefficient 0.36). However, using a debit card instead of a credit card and having multiple BNPL purchases on the go simultaneously were found to have no significant impact on financial wellbeing. Critically, Powell et al. find that younger users (aged under 25) exhibit significantly riskier financial behaviors: they spend less time analyzing BNPL terms and conditions (significant at 1% level), are less likely to plan and budget for purchases (significant at 5% level), and have significantly lower financial wellbeing scores (significant at 1% level). The <25 age group had a higher rate of missed payments (48% versus 39% for the 25+ group) and a larger proportion fell into lower financial wellbeing categories (25% versus 15% for the 25+ group). This finding is consistent with Agarwal et al.'s (2009) documentation that younger consumers make the worst financial decisions. The concentration of BNPL usage among younger consumers with less financial experience amplifies BNPL firms' exposure to default risk during economic downturns, creating an additional channel through which economic conditions affect BNPL firm performance.

Hayashi and Routh (2024) examine financial constraints among BNPL users. They find that BNPL users tend to be more financially vulnerable than non-users. There is a high correlation between BNPL late payments and financial vulnerability. BNPL users with late payments have overspent or overextended debt. This demonstrates that BNPL access facilitates overconsumption among financially constrained consumers. This finding has implications for understanding BNPL firms' sensitivity to economic conditions. Financially vulnerable consumers are likely to reduce spending and increase defaults when interest rates rise or economic conditions deteriorate.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Making Ends Meet Report (2022) provides broader context on financial vulnerability and income variability that affects BNPL users, using survey data from over 10,000 households. The report's findings inform my understanding of how macroeconomic conditions affect BNPL demand.

The report documents that income variability increased sharply from 2021 to 2022. The share of households experiencing income fluctuations rose from 28% in 2021 to 35% in 2022, creating conditions where consumers turn to BNPL to manage cash flow fluctuations. The report finds that 37% of households could not cover expenses for more than one month if income were lost, indicating widespread financial fragility that makes consumers particularly sensitive to economic shocks. Credit card debt increased substantially for Hispanic consumers and those under 40 between June 2021 and September 2022. Average credit card debt increased by approximately 15-20% for these demographic groups, demonstrating that these demographic groups, which overlap significantly with BNPL users, faced particular financial stress during this period.

Financial well-being, which had improved during the pandemic, returned to 2019 levels by February 2022. This indicates a deterioration in household financial conditions that coincided with the Federal Reserve's initial interest rate increases. These patterns demonstrate that BNPL firms serve consumers who face income volatility and financial constraints. BNPL demand is sensitive to changes in household financial conditions that are affected by interest rate changes and broader economic conditions. The documented relationship between income variability and BNPL usage provides motivation for including disposable income measures in my regression analysis. Changes in household financial conditions should affect BNPL demand and, consequently, BNPL stock returns.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's research (2024) provides complementary evidence. Financially fragile consumers (credit score below 620, recent credit denials) are almost three times more likely to have repeated BNPL use (five or more times) compared to financially stable consumers. The study finds that 72% of financially stable users and 89% of financially fragile users made multiple BNPL purchases. This indicates high rates of repeat usage. Most concerning, 10% of BNPL users pay BNPL installments with credit cards. This creates debt accumulation patterns that amplify financial vulnerability.

### 2.4 Market Growth and Industry Dynamics

The preceding sections have examined consumer behavior, firm profitability, and borrower characteristics. I now shift to a macro perspective: understanding the scale and trajectory of BNPL market growth provides essential context for evaluating the sector's sensitivity to economic conditions. Market size, growth rates, and industry structure affect how interest rate changes propagate through the sector and influence investor expectations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Market Trends Report (2022) analyzes the rapid growth of the BNPL industry. BNPL gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew from $2 billion in 2019 to $24.2 billion in 2021, representing a 1,092% compound annual growth rate. Transaction volume grew from 16.8 million loans in 2019 to 180 million loans in 2021, representing a 970% compound annual growth rate. Average loan size increased from $121 in 2019 to $135 in 2021, indicating both volume and size growth. BNPL accounts for 2-4% of e-commerce transactions, indicating substantial but not dominant market share. The report also shows vertical diversification. Apparel and beauty decreased from 80.1% of GMV in 2019 to 58.6% in 2021, while grocery and everyday purchases grew at a 736% compound annual growth rate. This diversification demonstrates that BNPL is expanding beyond discretionary purchases into everyday spending, which affects sensitivity to economic conditions.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Consumer Use of Buy Now, Pay Later Report (2025) provides updated analysis on market trends and regulatory developments affecting the sector. The report documents continued growth in BNPL adoption and examines the implications of regulatory changes, including the CFPB's May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit card issuers. This regulatory shift affects BNPL firms' funding structures, compliance costs, and competitive positioning, altering their sensitivity to interest rate changes. The report also examines consumer use patterns and debt accumulation, providing updated evidence on how BNPL fits into consumers' broader credit portfolios. The report's findings on consumer debt accumulation patterns and regulatory changes inform my understanding of how BNPL firms respond to changing market conditions and interest rate environments.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (2024) finds that BNPL grew particularly rapidly during the low-interest rate environment of the pandemic period. This indicates that interest rate conditions affect BNPL growth and profitability. This temporal pattern provides additional evidence that BNPL firms' performance is sensitive to monetary policy conditions. The sector's rapid expansion coincided with historically low interest rates.

Research on BNPL regulation provides insights into how regulatory frameworks affect BNPL firms' operations and sensitivity to economic conditions. Johnson, Rodwell, and Hendry (2021) examine the regulatory framework governing BNPL services, arguing that fee-based BNPL demonstrates multiple forms of regulatory failure. They identify regulatory capture as a key issue, with minimal consumer protections despite the complexity of BNPL financial products. Their analysis suggests that consumers may lack the financial knowledge required to fully understand BNPL terms and risks, particularly regarding fee structures and debt accumulation. This regulatory gap is significant because it allows BNPL firms to operate with less oversight than traditional credit providers, potentially exposing financially vulnerable consumers to greater risk. The regulatory uncertainty also affects BNPL firms' business models and funding structures, creating additional sensitivity to regulatory changes such as the CFPB's May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit card issuers.

### 2.5 Interest Rate Sensitivity and Funding Structure

The preceding sections have established the demand-side (consumer spending), supply-side (profitability structures), borrower characteristics, and market growth contexts. I now directly examine the core research question: the mechanisms through which interest rate changes affect BNPL firms. This section synthesizes evidence on funding structures, cost pass-through mechanisms, and firm-level responses to monetary policy changes, providing the theoretical foundation for my empirical analysis.

The theoretical framework for understanding financial institutions' interest rate sensitivity derives from Flannery and James (1984), who examine how financial institution stock returns respond to interest rate changes. They document that institutions with asset-liability maturity mismatches exhibit significant sensitivity to rate movements, with the magnitude depending on the duration gap structure. This framework applies directly to BNPL firms: their reliance on short-term wholesale funding combined with longer-maturity loan portfolios creates the duration mismatch that amplifies interest rate sensitivity.

BNPL firms exhibit sensitivity to interest rate changes primarily through their funding structure. Laudenbach et al. (2025) show that BNPL firms offer 1.4 percentage point interest rate discounts to consumers, indicating thin profit margins that amplify sensitivity to funding cost changes. BNPL firms must borrow capital from wholesale markets, creating direct exposure to interest rate changes that is not mitigated by deposit funding. This funding structure creates a transmission mechanism whereby monetary policy changes directly affect BNPL firms' cost of capital, which in turn affects profitability and stock returns.

Research on financial intermediation and funding costs provides theoretical foundations for understanding this mechanism. Institutions relying on wholesale funding exhibit stronger responses to interest rate changes than deposit-funded institutions. Wholesale funding costs adjust immediately to policy rate changes, while deposit rates adjust more slowly, creating differential sensitivity patterns. This framework helps explain why BNPL firms, which rely almost exclusively on wholesale funding, exhibit immediate pass-through of monetary policy changes to funding costs, unlike traditional banks that benefit from deposit funding stability.

As detailed in Section 1.1.2, Klarna's valuation trajectory from its $46 billion peak in June 2021 to its $13-14 billion IPO valuation in September 2025 provides compelling evidence of BNPL firms' sensitivity to interest rate environments. The 70% valuation decline coincided precisely with the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle, demonstrating how monetary policy affects BNPL firms through multiple channels: direct funding costs, capital market access, and investor expectations.

Affirm Holdings' Annual Report (2024) identifies "elevated interest rate environment" as a key risk factor, explicitly acknowledging interest rate sensitivity. The report shows that Affirm relies on warehouse credit facilities, securitization, and sale-and-repurchase agreements for funding, all of which typically carry variable interest rates tied to benchmark rates. According to Affirm's 10-K filings, funding costs increased dramatically during the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle (see Appendix A.1 for detailed analysis). The company uses interest rate swaps and caps to manage interest rate exposure, indicating that management recognizes the risk posed by interest rate changes.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (2024) finds that BNPL grew during the low-interest rate environment of the pandemic, demonstrating that interest rate conditions affect BNPL growth and profitability. The report also notes regulatory changes, specifically the CFPB's May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit card issuers, which affects BNPL firms' regulatory environment and funding costs. These firm-level disclosures and regulatory observations provide concrete evidence of the mechanisms through which monetary policy affects BNPL firms, supporting the theoretical framework that motivates my empirical analysis.

## 2.6 Research Contribution and Literature Gaps

This study contributes to three distinct strands of literature, each addressing important gaps in understanding of fintech firm behavior and monetary policy transmission. Before detailing these contributions, I explicitly identify the gaps in existing research that motivate this study.

**Gap 1: No Quantitative Estimates of BNPL Stock Return Sensitivity to Monetary Policy**

While extensive research documents BNPL's rapid growth (CFPB 2022) and thin profit margins (Laudenbach et al. 2025), no study quantifies how BNPL equity returns respond to Federal Funds Rate changes. This gap matters because:

- Stock returns incorporate forward-looking expectations about profitability
- Returns reflect multiple transmission channels simultaneously (funding costs, consumer demand, capital access)
- Investors need quantitative estimates to price BNPL-specific interest rate risk
- Policymakers need evidence on whether monetary policy disproportionately affects BNPL firms

Existing studies examine either consumer-side effects (Di Maggio et al. 2022) or firm-level margins (CFPB 2022), but none estimate the elasticity of BNPL stock returns to interest rate changes using multi-factor models that control for market movements and macroeconomic conditions. Bian, Cong, and Ji (2023) examine BNPL's role in payment competition and credit expansion, documenting that BNPL significantly boosts consumption and complements credit cards for small-value transactions, but do not directly address stock return sensitivity to interest rates. Laudenbach et al. (2025) analyze BNPL firms' funding costs and profitability, finding that funding costs increase with benchmark rates, but their analysis focuses on European markets and does not examine stock returns.

**Gap 2: Methodological Limitations in Existing Studies**

Existing studies face several methodological constraints that limit their ability to establish causal relationships between interest rates and BNPL performance. Many studies rely on cross-sectional data or short time series that do not capture the full variation in monetary policy conditions. For example, the CFPB Market Trends Report covers 2019-2021, a period characterized primarily by low and stable interest rates, limiting its ability to examine interest-rate sensitivity. Additionally, many studies lack appropriate control variables to isolate interest-rate effects from other macroeconomic factors. My analysis addresses these limitations by using a longer time series (February 2020 to August 2025) that captures substantial variation in monetary policy, and by controlling for market returns, consumer confidence, disposable income, and inflation.

**Gap 3: Limited Analysis of Transmission Mechanisms**

While the literature identifies potential mechanisms through which interest rates may affect BNPL firms (funding costs, consumer demand, capital market access), few studies systematically examine these mechanisms empirically or quantify their relative importance. My analysis addresses this gap by estimating a multi-factor regression model that allows me to examine multiple transmission channels simultaneously while isolating the direct effect of interest rate changes.

**Contributions:**

First, in the fintech valuation literature, this study analyzes how alternative financial service providers respond to macroeconomic shocks. While extensive research exists on traditional bank sensitivity to interest rates (Flannery and James 1984), relatively little work has analyzed how newer fintech lending models, particularly BNPL firms, respond to monetary policy changes. Research on BNPL regulation and consumer financial behavior provides important context but does not address stock return sensitivity to monetary policy. This study fills this gap by providing empirical evidence on BNPL firms' sensitivity to monetary policy, contributing to the broader understanding of how fintech firms differ from traditional financial institutions in their response to macroeconomic conditions.

Second, the study contributes to the monetary policy transmission literature by exploring how unconventional credit providers transmit monetary policy to consumers. Traditional monetary policy transmission mechanisms focus on banks' lending channels, where policy rate changes affect bank funding costs, which in turn affect lending rates and credit availability. However, BNPL firms represent an alternative credit provision mechanism that amplifies policy effects through different channels. Laudenbach et al. (2025) document that BNPL firms offer 1.4 percentage point interest rate discounts to consumers, indicating thin profit margins that amplify sensitivity to funding cost changes. Hayashi and Routh (2024) examine financial constraints among BNPL users, finding that BNPL borrowers exhibit higher credit card utilization rates and greater financial stress, which amplifies their sensitivity to economic shocks and interest rate changes. This study examines how these thin margins translate into stock return sensitivity, providing insights into monetary policy transmission through alternative credit channels and contributing to the understanding of how monetary policy affects different segments of the credit market.

Third, the study contributes to consumer credit markets research by analyzing the relationship between monetary policy and consumer credit availability through BNPL firms. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Consumer Use Report documents that BNPL borrowers have subprime credit scores (580-669) compared to non-users (670-739), higher credit card utilization rates (60-66% versus 34%), and are more likely to revolve on credit cards (69% versus 42%) (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, "Consumer Use"). Recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond documents the rapid growth of BNPL adoption and its implications for consumer credit markets, noting that BNPL has expanded particularly rapidly among younger consumers and those with limited access to traditional credit (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond). Understanding how monetary policy affects BNPL firms' ability to extend credit to these consumers has important implications for financial inclusion and consumer welfare, particularly given that BNPL serves consumers who have limited access to traditional credit products.



## 2.7 Firm-Level Context: PayPal and Affirm

Firm-level financial analysis provides microeconomic foundations for understanding BNPL firms' interest rate sensitivity. Affirm Holdings Inc. (AFRM), a pure-play BNPL provider, demonstrates the sector's vulnerability through its funding structure and cost dynamics. According to Affirm's 10-K filings, funding costs increased dramatically during the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle (see Appendix A.1 for detailed analysis). This demonstrates the direct pass-through mechanism: as benchmark rates increase, variable-rate funding facilities reset at higher rates, increasing the cost of capital. Affirm's high leverage and thin operating margins amplify the impact of funding cost increases on profitability. PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) operates a more diversified business model, with BNPL representing only a portion of its overall operations, potentially providing natural hedging against BNPL-specific funding cost pressures. Detailed financial analysis of these firms' 10-K filings from 2021-2024 is presented in the Appendix (Section A.1), which examines funding structures, loan portfolios, revenue growth relative to funding costs, and implications for sector-wide sensitivity patterns.

## 2.8 Bridge to Empirical Analysis: Literature-Informed Hypotheses

The literature review above establishes several key mechanisms through which BNPL firms may be sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, particularly monetary policy changes. These mechanisms inform the empirical analysis presented in Section 4 (Data Analysis) and motivate the inclusion of specific control variables in my regression framework.

**Interest Rate Sensitivity Hypothesis:** The literature provides strong theoretical motivation for expecting negative relationships between Federal Funds Rate changes and BNPL stock returns. Laudenbach et al. (2025) find that BNPL firms' funding costs increase by approximately 0.8-1.0 percentage points for each percentage point increase in benchmark interest rates. This indicates near-complete pass-through of monetary policy changes to funding costs. Affirm's 10-K filings provide firm-level evidence of this mechanism: according to Affirm's filings, funding costs increased dramatically during the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle (see Appendix A.1 for detailed analysis). Combined with thin profit margins (approximately 1% net transaction margins per CFPB Market Trends Report) and high leverage, these findings indicate that interest rate increases compress profit margins and reduce profitability. This should be reflected in negative stock returns. This theoretical framework motivates my primary hypothesis: BNPL stock returns respond negatively to Federal Funds Rate increases, after controlling for market movements and other macroeconomic factors.

**Consumer Confidence Channel:** The literature shows strong relationships between consumer sentiment and BNPL demand. Bian, Cong, and Ji (2023) find that a one-standard-deviation increase in consumer confidence is associated with approximately 8-12% increase in BNPL transaction volume. This indicates that consumer sentiment represents an important channel through which macroeconomic conditions affect BNPL firm performance. Di Maggio, Williams, and Katz (2022) find that BNPL access increases spending by approximately $130 per week, with spending remaining elevated for 24 weeks. This indicates that consumer spending patterns directly affect BNPL revenue streams. These findings motivate including consumer confidence measures in my regression analysis. Changes in consumer sentiment should affect BNPL demand and, consequently, stock returns.

**Disposable Income Channel:** The CFPB Making Ends Meet Report (2022) finds that income variability increased sharply from 2021 to 2022. Thirty-seven percent of households were unable to cover expenses for more than one month if income were lost. The report also finds that credit card debt increased substantially for demographic groups that overlap significantly with BNPL users. This indicates that changes in household financial conditions affect BNPL demand. These patterns indicate that disposable income measures should be included in my regression analysis. Changes in household financial conditions affect BNPL demand and stock returns.

**Market Returns and Inflation:** The literature provides less direct evidence on market returns and inflation effects. However, standard asset pricing theory, particularly the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and multi-factor models, suggests that BNPL stock returns should be correlated with market returns through systematic risk factors. The high market beta observed in my regression results (β₅ = 2.38) confirms this theoretical prediction. Inflation may affect BNPL firms through multiple channels: its impact on consumer purchasing power reduces discretionary spending capacity, its effect on funding costs increases the cost of capital, and its influence on economic uncertainty affects consumer confidence and credit demand. I include these variables as controls to isolate the effect of interest rate changes while accounting for broader market movements and macroeconomic conditions, ensuring that my interest rate coefficient captures BNPL-specific sensitivity rather than general market or macroeconomic effects.

**Empirical Strategy:** My regression framework, detailed in Section 4, employs a log-linear specification that allows me to estimate elasticities of BNPL stock returns with respect to interest rate changes and other macroeconomic variables. This functional form choice is motivated by both theoretical considerations and empirical evidence. The log transformation addresses heteroskedasticity and distributional skewness common in financial return data, while facilitating elasticity interpretation that is standard in financial econometrics. I employ a two-stage approach that follows established practices in monetary policy transmission research. I begin with a parsimonious base specification that examines the relationship between BNPL returns and interest rate changes, providing a benchmark estimate of interest rate sensitivity. I then estimate a full specification model that incorporates consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation, and market returns as control variables. This sequential estimation strategy serves multiple purposes: it allows me to assess both direct effects of monetary policy on BNPL stock performance and the incremental explanatory power of including additional control variables, it tests the theoretical mechanisms identified in the literature review above, and it enables me to examine the robustness of the interest rate coefficient to the inclusion of control variables, addressing concerns about omitted variable bias.
