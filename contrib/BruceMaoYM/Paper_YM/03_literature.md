## Literature Review: BNPL Market Dynamics and Interest Rate Sensitivity

The Buy Now, Pay Later sector has grown rapidly, yet empirical research on how BNPL firms respond to monetary policy changes remains limited. While extensive literature examines BNPL adoption, consumer behavior, and market growth, few studies directly analyze how interest rate changes affect BNPL firm performance through stock returns. This gap motivates the present analysis, which quantifies BNPL firms' interest rate sensitivity using stock return data while controlling for confounding factors. This review synthesizes three interconnected literatures: (1) interest rate sensitivity of financial institutions, which provides theoretical benchmarks and empirical patterns; (2) fintech valuation and funding structures, which reveal how technology-enabled lenders differ from traditional banks; and (3) BNPL market dynamics and consumer behavior, which illuminate demand-side factors that affect firm performance.

### Interest Rate Sensitivity of Financial Institutions: Theoretical Benchmarks

Bank stock return sensitivity to interest rate changes provides a natural benchmark for evaluating BNPL rate sensitivity. Flannery and James (1984) establish the foundational framework, documenting that bank stock returns exhibit negative sensitivity to interest rate increases, with coefficients ranging from approximately -5 to -10 depending on bank characteristics {cite}`Flannery1984`. Their analysis decomposes rate sensitivity into maturity mismatch effects and funding cost pass-through, finding that banks with greater maturity mismatches exhibit stronger negative sensitivity. This framework proves particularly relevant for BNPL firms, which face similar funding cost pressures but operate with different structural advantages and constraints.

English, Van den Heuvel, and Zakrajšek (2018) extend this analysis using modern data and econometric methods, finding that U.S. bank stock returns exhibit economically and statistically significant negative sensitivity, with estimated coefficients of approximately $\beta \approx -6$ to $-8$ for large banks {cite}`English2018`. Critically, they document that rate sensitivity varies systematically with funding structures: banks that heavily rely on core deposits exhibit more pronounced negative sensitivity, while banks with substantial maturity mismatches experience less severe impacts. This finding informs expectations for BNPL firms, which rely almost exclusively on wholesale funding rather than deposits, suggesting potentially different sensitivity patterns than traditional banks with stable deposit bases.

Gandhi and Lustig (2015) examine asset pricing in bank stocks, finding that bank size influences exposure to market beta and interest rate sensitivity, with larger banks more sensitive to monetary policy shocks primarily transmitted through the market risk factor {cite}`Gandhi2015`. This dual nature—market beta exposure combined with rate sensitivity—creates a natural comparison point for BNPL stocks. If BNPL firms are priced similarly to banks, they should exhibit both market beta exposure and rate sensitivity. However, as subsequent sections reveal, BNPL firms may differ from banks in ways that affect this relationship.

Bernanke and Kuttner (2005) examine what explains stock market reactions to Federal Reserve policy, documenting that stock prices respond to monetary policy surprises primarily through the discount rate channel (affecting expected excess returns), with cash flow effects playing a smaller role {cite}`Bernanke2005`. Their framework for understanding how monetary policy affects equity valuations provides theoretical context for analyzing BNPL stock return sensitivity. The discount rate channel operates through valuation effects on expected returns, particularly relevant for growth-stage firms with long-duration cash flows, while cash flow channels may operate through various mechanisms including funding costs and profitability.

The theoretical prediction from this literature is clear: financial institutions with high reliance on wholesale funding, thin profit margins, and direct pass-through of funding costs should exhibit negative rate sensitivity with coefficients in the range of $\beta \approx -5$ to $-10$. Banks achieve this sensitivity through deposit-taking and lending activities, where rate increases raise funding costs faster than lending rates due to deposit rate stickiness. BNPL firms face similar funding cost pressures but lack the deposit funding advantage, suggesting potentially stronger negative sensitivity if funding costs fully pass through to profitability.

### Fintech Valuation and Funding Structures: Regulatory Arbitrage and Operational Flexibility

The fintech literature reveals mechanisms through which technology-enabled lenders may differ from traditional banks in their response to interest rate changes. Buchak et al. (2018) provide crucial theoretical context, showing that fintech lenders exploit regulatory arbitrage to expand market share, with regulatory factors accounting for approximately 60% of shadow bank growth {cite}`Buchak2018`. Fintech lenders charge a premium of 14-16 basis points, suggesting they offer convenience rather than cost savings. If BNPL firms can maintain market share through regulatory advantages and convenience features during rate hikes, funding costs may not fully affect profitability if firms can pass costs through or sustain temporary losses while maintaining competitive positioning. This mechanism may predict weaker rate sensitivity ($\beta_{BNPL} \approx 0$) than traditional banks if regulatory advantages allow operational flexibility, creating a competing theoretical prediction that contrasts with the bank-based benchmark.

Acharya et al. (2013) examine securitization structures and funding mechanisms, documenting how firms with arms-length funding (securitization, asset-backed securities) differ from bank-funded operations {cite}`Acharya2013`. BNPL firms rely heavily on securitization and warehouse facilities, which may create different rate sensitivity patterns than bank-funded credit card operations. However, if securitization structures lock in fixed rates for extended periods, short-term rate changes may not immediately affect funding costs, creating a lagged sensitivity pattern. This tension between immediate pass-through (through variable-rate facilities) and delayed effects (through fixed-rate securitization) adds complexity to theoretical predictions.

Berg et al. (2020) examine the rise of fintechs and credit scoring using digital footprints, documenting how fintech lenders operate with different cost structures than traditional banks {cite}`Berg2020`. Their analysis reveals that fintech lenders use alternative data and pricing mechanisms that differ from traditional banks, which has implications for understanding how economic conditions affect BNPL demand and default risk. The concentration of BNPL usage among lower-creditworthiness consumers, combined with thin profit margins, suggests vulnerability to economic shocks that may amplify rate sensitivity through credit risk channels.

Fuster et al. (2019) examine the role of technology in mortgage lending, documenting how fintech lenders use technology to assess credit risk and serve different borrower segments {cite}`Fuster2019`. Their analysis of fintech lending models provides insights into how technology-enabled lenders respond to economic conditions, which is relevant for understanding BNPL firm behavior. Technology-enabled credit assessment may allow BNPL firms to adjust pricing and risk management more quickly than traditional banks, potentially moderating rate sensitivity through operational flexibility.

### Funding Structure Comparison: BNPL vs. Banks vs. Credit Cards

Theoretical predictions about rate sensitivity depend critically on funding structures. The following comparison examines funding models across BNPL providers, traditional banks, and credit card issuers, highlighting key differences that inform empirical expectations.

This comparison reveals critical differences that generate competing theoretical predictions. BNPL providers face immediate funding cost pass-through through variable-rate warehouse facilities, suggesting potentially stronger negative rate sensitivity than banks if costs fully transmit to profitability. However, BNPL firms' thin profit margins (approximately 1%) limit their capacity to absorb funding cost shocks, creating pressure to pass costs through to merchants and consumers. If pass-through is complete, stock returns should be insensitive to funding costs. If pass-through is incomplete due to competitive pressures, stock returns should exhibit negative sensitivity.

Banks, by contrast, benefit from deposit rate stickiness, which creates a natural hedge: deposit rates adjust slowly while lending rates adjust more quickly, partially insulating net interest margins from rate changes. Credit card issuers occupy an intermediate position, with funding structures that vary by issuer type. This structural comparison sets up the empirical question: do BNPL firms exhibit stronger negative sensitivity than banks (due to immediate pass-through and lack of deposit advantages), or do they exhibit weak sensitivity (due to complete cost pass-through or regulatory arbitrage)?

### Competing Theoretical Predictions

The funding structure comparison, combined with insights from fintech and banking literatures, generates four competing theoretical predictions. First, if BNPL firms operate like banks with immediate funding cost pass-through but without deposit advantages, they should exhibit stronger negative rate sensitivity than banks, with $\beta_{BNPL} < \beta_{Banks}$ (more negative), potentially in the range of $\beta_{BNPL} \approx -10$ to $-15$. Second, if BNPL firms can pass all funding costs to merchants and consumers through pricing adjustments, stock returns should be insensitive to funding costs ($\beta_{BNPL} \approx 0$). Third, if regulatory arbitrage allows BNPL firms to maintain below-market pricing during rate hikes, funding costs may not affect profitability, predicting weak or zero rate sensitivity ($\beta_{BNPL} \approx 0$) even if funding costs rise. Fourth, if securitization structures lock in fixed rates for extended periods, short-term rate changes may not immediately affect funding costs, creating lagged or weak sensitivity.

The empirical question is which mechanism dominates: competitive pressures and merchant bargaining power may prevent complete pass-through, while regulatory advantages may allow firms to sustain losses on funding costs. The empirical analysis tests these competing predictions by estimating rate sensitivity coefficients and comparing them to bank benchmarks.

### Consumer Behavior and BNPL Demand: Demand-Side Factors

Research on consumer spending patterns and credit behavior provides foundational context for understanding BNPL market dynamics and how demand-side factors may moderate or amplify rate sensitivity. Gathergood et al. (2019) examine how individuals repay debt, finding that consumers use balance-matching heuristics that affect credit utilization patterns {cite}`Gathergood2019`. This research on debt repayment behavior is relevant for understanding BNPL usage, as BNPL transactions represent a form of credit that consumers must manage alongside other debt obligations. The spending response to BNPL access motivates the inclusion of consumer confidence as a control variable, as BNPL transaction volumes and firm revenues depend on consumer willingness to spend.

Powell et al. (2023) examine the relationship between responsible financial behaviors and financial wellbeing in the context of BNPL, documenting patterns of usage and repayment behavior {cite}`Powell2023`. Cervellati et al. (2025) analyze BNPL consumer credit behavior and its impacts on financing decisions, finding that BNPL services significantly affect consumers' financing decisions and highlighting the need for further exploration into their long-term financial implications {cite}`Cervellati2025`. These findings suggest that consumer financial conditions and attitudes toward BNPL may affect demand patterns, further justifying including consumer confidence measures in the regression framework. These demand-side factors create an additional channel through which interest rates may affect BNPL firm performance: higher rates reduce consumer spending power and confidence, potentially reducing BNPL transaction volumes independently of funding cost effects.

The literature on BNPL's effects on consumer financial health reveals important patterns relevant to understanding firm-level risk. de Haan, Kim, Lourie, and Zhu (2024) show that new BNPL users experience rapid increases in bank overdraft charges and credit card interest and fees relative to non-users, consistent with BNPL facilitating overborrowing {cite}`deHaan2024`. These findings indicate that BNPL users may be financially fragile, which has implications for firm-level credit risk: financially fragile customers may experience higher default rates during monetary tightening cycles, potentially affecting BNPL firm profitability and stock returns through credit loss channels.

Gerrans, Baur, and Lavagna-Slater (2022) examine fintech and responsibility in BNPL arrangements, analyzing consumer behavior and over-indebtedness concerns, particularly among younger consumers and those in deprived areas {cite}`Gerrans2022`. These findings suggest that BNPL firms' customer bases may be particularly vulnerable to economic shocks, amplifying the potential for credit losses during monetary tightening cycles. This vulnerability creates a second channel for rate sensitivity: even if funding costs are fully passed through, higher rates may increase default rates among financially fragile borrowers, reducing profitability and stock returns.

### Consumer Credit Characteristics and Financial Vulnerability

Research on consumer credit characteristics reveals the financial vulnerability of BNPL borrowers, which informs expectations about how monetary policy tightening may affect BNPL firms through credit risk channels. Agarwal et al. (2009) examine financial decisions over the life cycle, documenting that younger consumers and those with lower incomes make different credit choices than older, higher-income consumers {cite}`Agarwal2009`. This research provides context for understanding BNPL user demographics: users are disproportionately young, have lower incomes, and face greater financial constraints than non-users, with BNPL serving as a mechanism for consumption smoothing among liquidity-constrained households. Consumers primarily adopt these services to manage cash flow and avoid credit card interest, suggesting that BNPL demand responds to broader credit market conditions.

Hayashi and Routh find that financial constraints drive BNPL usage, with high correlation between BNPL late payments and financial vulnerability, suggesting that economic conditions affecting household liquidity directly impact BNPL demand {cite}`Hayashi2025`. These patterns of financial fragility among BNPL users suggest that the sector may be particularly vulnerable to monetary policy tightening, as rate increases could exacerbate repayment difficulties among already-stressed borrowers. This vulnerability operates through multiple channels: reduced consumer spending power, increased financial stress, and higher default rates, all of which may affect BNPL firm profitability and stock returns independently of direct funding cost effects.

### BNPL Profitability and Funding Costs: Firm-Level Evidence

Research on fintech credit scoring and profitability directly informs expectations about interest rate sensitivity. Berg et al. (2020) examine the rise of fintechs and credit scoring using digital footprints, documenting how fintech lenders operate with different cost structures than traditional banks {cite}`Berg2020`. Large listed BNPL providers appear to operate with thin net margins, suggesting limited capacity to absorb funding cost shocks without passing them through to pricing. This distinction is crucial: pass-through to borrowers and merchants is not the same as pass-through to profitability (what matters for stock returns). If BNPL firms can pass all costs to merchants and consumers, then funding cost increases should not affect stock prices.

Affirm's 10-K filings show that GAAP net revenue increased from $1.35 billion in FY 2022 to $2.32 billion in FY 2024 (a 72% cumulative increase), while net revenue in FY 2024 was 46% higher than in FY 2023. Over the same period, the firm reports that its funding costs increased by 88% year-over-year in FY 2024 relative to FY 2023, reflecting both higher benchmark rates and greater usage of warehouse and securitization funding. Between FY 2023 and FY 2024, Affirm's funding costs grew faster than net revenue (88% vs 46% year-over-year), which could reflect incomplete pass-through to revenues, competitive pressures limiting pricing power, scale economies, or time lags in pricing adjustments. However, this comparison does not directly test pass-through, as revenue growth reflects both pricing changes and volume growth, while funding cost growth reflects both rate changes and volume growth.

### Synthesis and Empirical Expectations

This literature review establishes competing theoretical predictions through multiple interconnected channels. Bank stock return studies (Flannery and James 1984, English et al. 2018) document negative rate sensitivity with coefficients of approximately $\beta \approx -5$ to $-10$, providing a benchmark for evaluating BNPL sensitivity. The funding structure comparison reveals that BNPL firms face immediate funding cost pass-through through variable-rate facilities, suggesting potentially stronger negative sensitivity than banks if costs fully transmit to profitability. However, BNPL firms' thin profit margins and reliance on merchant and consumer pricing create conditions where complete cost pass-through could insulate stock returns from funding cost changes.

Fintech valuation literature (Buchak et al. 2018) and corporate finance research (Acharya et al. 2013) suggest additional mechanisms—regulatory arbitrage and fixed-rate securitization structures—through which operational flexibility and funding choices may insulate equity valuations from rate changes. Consumer behavior research (Gathergood et al. 2019, Powell et al. 2023, Cervellati et al. 2025) reveals demand-side factors that may moderate or amplify rate sensitivity through spending and credit utilization channels. Research on consumer financial vulnerability (Agarwal et al. 2009, Hayashi and Routh 2025, de Haan et al. 2024, Gerrans et al. 2022) suggests that BNPL firms' customer bases may be particularly vulnerable to economic shocks, creating credit risk channels through which rate increases may affect profitability independently of direct funding cost effects.

The strong theoretical motivation for expecting negative relationships between Federal Funds Rate changes and BNPL stock returns comes from the combination of thin profit margins (limiting capacity to absorb funding cost shocks), high funding cost pass-through to benchmark rates, and concentration of BNPL usage among financially vulnerable consumers. However, competing mechanisms—complete cost pass-through, regulatory arbitrage, and operational flexibility—may moderate or eliminate this sensitivity.

Based on theoretical predictions, the expected coefficient magnitude is approximately -10 to -15, indicating that a one percentage point rate increase would be associated with a 10 to 15 percentage point decline in BNPL stock returns. This prediction reflects the combination of thin profit margins, high funding cost pass-through, and financial vulnerability of BNPL consumers. However, the empirical analysis must account for the possibility that competing mechanisms dominate, resulting in weak or zero sensitivity. The empirical analysis employs a log-linear specification estimated in two stages: a base model with only interest rate changes, followed by a full model adding consumer confidence, disposable income, inflation, and market returns as controls. This approach isolates the interest rate effect while assessing the incremental explanatory power of additional variables that the literature identifies as relevant to BNPL firm performance.
