    "Table 1 presents the results of the dynamic panel estimation using the PanelOLS within-estimator on the updated dataset covering 16,022 entities. The model exhibits strong explanatory power, yielding a within-$R^2$ of 0.7156 and an overall $R^2$ of 0.8919. The high robust F-statistic (1327.3) and the significance of the poolability test ($p < 0.0001$) confirm that the inclusion of bank-level fixed effects is essential for capturing unobserved heterogeneity across institutions.\n",

    "The coefficient on the lagged dependent variable, $Risk_{i,t-1}$, is **0.8319** ($t = 66.22, p < 0.001$). This indicates an exceptionally high degree of inertia in bank loan-to-asset ratios, suggesting that over 83% of a bank's risk profile from the preceding quarter persists into the current period. This result underscores the importance of the dynamic specification; the high persistence suggests that structural impediments or long-term strategic planning dominate quarterly adjustments in loan portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main effect of the standardized Fed sentiment shock ($Shock_{t-1}$) is estimated at **-0.0002** and is statistically indistinguishable from zero ($p = 0.464$). Because the model uses centered log assets, this coefficient reflects the response of a bank of **average size**. This null result implies that for the typical (average-sized) U.S. bank, qualitative sentiment shocks from the Federal Reserve do not independently drive changes in risk-taking behavior when separated from the interaction with bank size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The central finding of this analysis is the robust significance of the interaction term between sentiment and bank size. The coefficient for $Shock_{t-1} \\times Size_{i,t-1}$ is **0.0001** and is significant at the 1% level ($t = 2.99, p = 0.0028$).\n",
    "\n",
    "This positive interaction reveals a clear divergence in monetary transmission: as bank size increases, the sensitivity to Fed sentiment rises. Larger banks—likely benefiting from fewer financial constraints and greater capacity to process central bank information—expand their C&I loan portfolios more aggressively in response to optimistic Fed signaling. Conversely, smaller banks appear insulated from or unresponsive to this specific channel. This strongly supports the **Constraint Channel** hypothesis, where the transmission of soft information is conditional on the financial flexibility and scale of the intermediary.\n",

    "\n",
    "The lagged Federal Funds Rate ($\\beta = 0.0004, p < 0.001$) shows a positive and significant association with the C&I loan ratio. This suggests that, controlling for sentiment, higher interest rates are associated with a slight increase in the share of C&I loans on balance sheets, potentially reflecting a \"search for yield\" or demand-side shifts during tightening cycles. The direct effect of bank size ($log\\_assets\\_centered\\_lag$) is statistically insignificant ($p = 0.903$), indicating that size alone does not dictate changes in risk appetite once fixed effects and interaction terms are accounted for."
