### Conclusion

The primary objective of this study was to isolate the genuinely exogenous component of the Sentiment Shock and evaluate its causal impact on bank risk-taking. We achieved this by rigorously removing systematic variation driven by the Federal Funds Rate. The results unequivocally confirm the efficacy of this orthogonalization procedure and the existence of a heterogeneous "Sentiment Channel" in monetary policy.

The methodological success of the orthogonalization was two-fold. Quantitatively, the Raw Sentiment Shock exhibited a high correlation with the Rate ($r \approx 0.8$), confounding initial interpretations. By regressing the Raw Shock on the Rate and extracting the residuals, we generated a Purged Sentiment Shock with near-zero correlation ($r \approx 0.00$) to the Rate. This purification ensures that our subsequent regression results are free from multicollinearity and endogeneity concerns related to the mechanical path of interest rates.

Building on this clean identification, our dynamic panel analysis of over 720,000 observations yields a critical economic insight: **the impact of Fed sentiment is not uniform.** While the average bank shows no significant response to sentiment shocks, the highly significant positive interaction with bank size ($p < 0.01$) demonstrates that large banks are the primary conduits for this transmission channel. This finding suggests that "soft" monetary policy—communicated through tone and optimism rather than rate changes—is effective primarily through institutions with the scale and sophistication to act on such signals. Consequently, policymakers must account for this heterogeneity: sentiment shocks may disproportionately influence the credit supply of the largest systemic institutions while leaving smaller community banks relatively unaffected.
