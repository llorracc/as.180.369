               when risk premiums are compressed, there is an increased
               likelihood of a reversal that damages the credit-supply mechanism
               and the real economy. Together these effects create an
               intertemporal tradeoff for monetary policy, as stimulating the
               economy today can sow the seeds of a future downturn that might
               be difficult to offset. We draw out some implications of this

               monetary policy by revisiting and extending event-study analysis
               of Federal Open Market Committee announcements. We document
               significant effects of unexpected monetary policy changes on risk
               indicators drawn from equity, fixed-income, credit, and foreign
               exchange markets. We develop a new index of risk appetite based
               on the common component of these indicators. Surprise monetary
               easing leads to strong and persistent increases in our index, and
               vice versa for tightening surprises, consistent with the view
               that monetary policy affects asset prices in large part through
               its effects on risk appetite. We discuss the implications of the
