### Literature Review
The central question of this investigation is whether the sentiment of central bank communication acts as a distinct driver of bank risk-taking, separate from the traditional interest rate channel. To contextualize this inquiry, we review three distinct strands of economic literature: the “Risk-Taking Channel” of monetary policy, the “Information Effect” of central bank announcements, and the nascent application of textual analysis to monetary policy.
  

First, a substantial body of research has established the existence of a “Risk-Taking Channel” of monetary policy, a concept formally articulated by Borio & Zhu (2012). They posit that low interest rates do more than just stimulate demand through the traditional cost-of-capital channel; they also incentivize financial intermediaries to search for yield by expanding their risk tolerance. This theoretical framework suggests that monetary policy affects the perception and pricing of risk, not just the risk-free rate.
  

Empirical evidence supports this view. Using granular data from the Spanish Credit Register, Jiménez et al. (2014) found that lower overnight rates induce banks to grant more loans to ex-ante risky borrowers, particularly among less capitalized banks. Similarly, Dell’Ariccia et al. (2017) provided cross-country evidence confirming that prolonged periods of low interest rates are associated with higher risk-taking in the banking sector. These foundational studies establish that the actions of the central bank (rate setting) fundamentally alter bank balance sheets. However, they largely abstract away from the words used to convey these actions.
  

This gap leads to the second strand of literature: the “Information Effect” of central bank communication. As central banks have moved toward transparency and forward guidance, researchers have sought to disentangle the impact of policy actions from policy announcements. Nakamura & Steinsson (2018) identified a crucial “Fed Information Effect,” showing that FOMC announcements often convey the Fed’s private assessment of the economic outlook. They found that a surprise monetary tightening can sometimes raise long-term inflation expectations—a counter-intuitive result explained by the market interpreting the hike as a signal that the Fed sees a stronger-than-expected economy. Building on this, Cieslak & Schrimpf (2019) utilized high-frequency data to decompose central bank announcements into “monetary news” (rate shocks) and “non-monetary news” (risk premia and economic outlook shocks). They demonstrate that non-monetary news is a primary driver of equity prices, suggesting that the “tone” of the announcement matters as much as the decision itself. Hansen & McMahon (2016) further show that different aspects of communication affect different parts of the economy; forward guidance shapes the yield curve, while discussion of current economic conditions impacts macroeconomic variables. These studies confirm that communication moves financial markets, but they stop short of establishing whether this “soft” information penetrates the “hard” lending decisions of commercial banks.
  

Finally, our methodology draws upon recent advances in textual and sentiment analysis** within economics. As the volume of unstructured data has grown, economists have turned to natural language processing (NLP) to quantify the qualitative aspects of policy. Hansen, McMahon & Prat (2018) analyzed the transcripts of FOMC meetings to show how increased transparency changes the deliberation process itself. More specifically related to sentiment, Shapiro et al. (2022) developed text-based measures of economic uncertainty and sentiment, finding that “sentiment shocks” derived from news text have predictive power for consumption and output. In the context of the European Central Bank, Ehrmann & Talmi (2020) analyzed the “tone” of introductory statements and Q&A sessions, finding that the sentiment of the Q&A session specifically exerts a strong influence on financial market yields. Furthermore, Schmeling & Wagner (2019) demonstrated that the tone of central bank communication predicts future stock returns, arguing that “tone” captures a risk premium component that is not reflected in standard macro variables.
  

Taken together, these literatures present a compelling puzzle. We know that low rates increase bank risk-taking (Borio & Zhu, 2012). We know that central bank communication contains distinct “non-monetary” information that moves markets (Nakamura & Steinsson, 2018). And we know that the “tone” of this communication can be quantified and has predictive power for asset prices (Shapiro et al., 2022). However, there remains a lack of empirical evidence linking the sentiment of the central bank directly to the lending portfolios of commercial banks. This paper attempts to fill that void by treating Fed sentiment not merely as a reflection of the economy, but as an independent policy lever that may constrain or encourage bank risk-taking through a “Signaling Channel.”
