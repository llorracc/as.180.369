### Introduction
The transmission of monetary policy to the real economy is a cornerstone of macroeconomic research, with the “risk-taking channel” emerging as a critical mechanism.
  

A substantial body of work, pioneered by scholars such as Borio and Zhu (2012), Jiménez et al. (2014), and Dell’Ariccia et al. (2017), has robustly demonstrated that periods of low interest rates encourage banks to extend credit to riskier borrowers, thereby increasing the overall risk in the financial system. This literature establishes a clear link between the level of the policy rate and the risk appetite of financial intermediaries.
  

However, the conduct of modern monetary policy extends far beyond the mere setting of a target interest rate. Central bank communication has evolved into a powerful policy tool in its own right. Research has shown that the information conveyed in central bank announcements can significantly move markets, independent of any policy action. Cieslak and Schrimpf (2019) distinguish between “monetary news” and “non-monetary news,” finding that the latter—information pertaining to economic outlook and risk sentiment—is a primary driver of asset prices. Similarly, Nakamura and Steinsson (2018) identify an “information effect,” where central bank announcements reveal the bank’s private assessment of the economy, influencing market expectations in ways that can even counteract the traditional effects of a rate change.


This paper bridges these two strands of literature to ask a critical question: Does the “Information Effect” penetrate the balance sheets of commercial banks? While the risk-taking channel focuses on the price of credit, we investigate whether the sentiment embedded in central bank communications can independently alter banks’ willingness to assume risk.

  
Testing this hypothesis presents significant econometric hurdles. First, Fed sentiment is highly endogenous; the Fed tends to sound optimistic when the economy is strong and interest rates are rising. Second, bank lending is highly persistent—a bank’s loan portfolio today is the strongest predictor of its portfolio tomorrow. To robustly test the “Sentiment Channel,” we construct a comprehensive panel dataset spanning 35 years (1984–2019) and employ a rigorous identification strategy. We first orthogonalize Fed sentiment from the Federal Funds Rate to create a “Pure Sentiment Shock.” We then estimate the impact of this shock using an Anderson-Hsiao dynamic panel model, which uses instrumental variables to correct for the biases inherent in measuring persistent banking data.

  
Our results provide a sobering counter-narrative to the efficacy of forward guidance in banking. We find that once the mechanical correlation with interest rates is removed, “pure” Fed sentiment has no statistically significant impact on bank risk-taking. Furthermore, we find no evidence that small banks are more sensitive to these signals than large banks. The data suggests that while the Fed’s words may move markets, they do not move bank balance sheets; only the tangible cost of capital—the Federal Funds Rate—drives lending behavior.
