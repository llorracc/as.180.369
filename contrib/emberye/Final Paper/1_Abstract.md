# Abstract

This study investigates the relationship between vocational training investment and economic output across 27 European Union member states using 2015 cross-sectional data from the Eurostat Continuing Vocational Training Survey. Employing a sequential modeling approach, I estimate the association between training expenditure per employee and GDP per capita while progressively controlling for tertiary educational attainment, regional fixed effects, and firm size composition. The baseline model reveals a strong positive correlation (β = 80.56, p < 0.001), which remains statistically significant across specifications, with the training coefficient ranging from €33 to €71 per euro invested depending on controls included. Stratified regressions by firm size uncover substantial heterogeneity: small firms exhibit the largest training coefficient (β = 117.75), nearly three times that of large firms (β = 40.88), suggesting diminishing marginal returns as firm size increases. While the cross-sectional design and limited sample size preclude causal inference, the robustness of the training-GDP relationship across model specifications provides suggestive evidence that employer-sponsored vocational training represents a meaningful lever for enhancing national productivity. Policy implications point toward prioritizing training subsidies for small and medium enterprises, where returns appear highest.
