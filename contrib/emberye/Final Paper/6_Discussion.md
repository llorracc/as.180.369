This study provides cross-national evidence that vocational training investment is positively and robustly associated with economic output across European countries. The training coefficient remains statistically significant across multiple specifications—controlling for tertiary education, regional fixed effects, and firm size composition—suggesting that the relationship is not merely an artifact of confounding factors. The baseline estimate implies that each additional euro invested in training per employee is associated with approximately €70–80 higher GDP per capita, a magnitude that persists even in the most demanding specifications. This finding aligns with human capital theory, which posits that employer-sponsored training enhances worker productivity through skill acquisition, knowledge transfer, and organizational learning (Becker, 1964). Unlike formal education, which operates primarily at the pre-employment stage, vocational training represents ongoing investment in the existing workforce, potentially offering more immediate and targeted productivity gains. As Izushi and Huggins (2004) demonstrate in their European analysis, the rate of economic growth is determined by the accumulation of human capital, not merely by existing stocks—implying that continuous training investment matters for sustaining productivity gains.

The stratified analysis by firm size reveals an intriguing pattern of heterogeneity: training investment appears most strongly associated with GDP in small firms (β = 117.75), with progressively smaller coefficients for medium (β = 80.21) and large firms (β = 40.88). Several mechanisms may explain this gradient. Small firms likely deploy training resources more precisely toward immediate skill gaps, whereas large firms may invest in broader development programs with more diffuse or delayed returns. Additionally, training expenditure represents a larger proportional commitment for small enterprises, potentially signaling stronger organizational investment in human capital development. From a policy perspective, this heterogeneity suggests that targeting vocational training subsidies toward small and medium enterprises may yield higher marginal returns than equivalent investments in large firms, which often have greater internal capacity for workforce development.

Several limitations constrain the interpretation of these findings. Most critically, the small sample size (n = 27–29 countries) limits statistical power, inflates standard errors, and restricts the number of controls that can be included without risking overfitting. The cross-sectional design precludes causal inference; reverse causality remains plausible, as wealthier countries may simply have greater resources to invest in training. Omitted variable bias is also a concern despite the sequential addition of controls—unobserved factors such as institutional quality, technological sophistication, or cultural attitudes toward skill development may drive both training investment and economic output. The high condition numbers observed in several models indicate multicollinearity, particularly when region and education controls are included simultaneously, which reduces the precision of individual coefficient estimates.

Future research should address these limitations through panel data analysis exploiting temporal variation in training investment, which would allow for country fixed effects and stronger identification of within-country relationships. Instrumental variable approaches—potentially using policy changes or EU funding shocks as exogenous variation in training investment—could help establish causality. Additionally, micro-level studies linking firm-level training expenditure to productivity outcomes would complement this macro-level analysis and help clarify the mechanisms through which training translates into economic output. Despite these limitations, the consistent positive association observed across specifications provides suggestive evidence that vocational training investment merits serious policy attention as a lever for enhancing national productivity and economic performance.
