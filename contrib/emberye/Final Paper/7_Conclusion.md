# Conclusion

This study examined the relationship between vocational training investment and economic output across 27 European countries using 2015 Eurostat data. The findings demonstrate a robust positive association between training expenditure per employee and GDP per capita, with the training coefficient remaining statistically significant across multiple model specifications controlling for tertiary education, regional fixed effects, and firm size composition. The stratified analysis by firm size revealed that training investment yields the highest marginal returns in small firms (β = 117.75), followed by medium (β = 80.21) and large firms (β = 40.88), suggesting diminishing returns as firm size increases. While the cross-sectional design and limited sample size preclude causal inference, the stability of the training coefficient across specifications provides suggestive evidence that vocational training represents a meaningful correlate of national economic performance beyond what can be explained by formal education or industrial structure alone. These findings carry policy implications for EU member states: governments seeking to enhance productivity may benefit from prioritizing vocational training subsidies, particularly for small and medium enterprises where returns appear highest and where firms may lack internal resources for workforce development.
