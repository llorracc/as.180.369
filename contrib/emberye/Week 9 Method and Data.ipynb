    "In their article “Vocational Training Costs and Economic Benefits: Exploring the Interactions,” Samoliuk, Bilan, and Mishchuk (2021) focus on identifying whether a positive relationship exists between vocational training costs and economic performance, rather than measuring the magnitude of that relationship. Their approach reflects an interest in the direction and consistency of the link—whether higher training costs are generally associated with higher economic outcomes such as GDP per capita—rather than in quantifying how much GDP increases per unit of cost. The authors note that previous research has already established the measurable economic benefits of training at the firm level, including increases in productivity, wages, and profitability. However, at the macroeconomic level, the connection between education-related investments and growth often produces inconsistent results due to cross-country differences in development and data comparability. For this reason, Samoliuk et al. employ a correlation-based approach (such as the Fechner correlation) that tests whether the relationship is systematically positive across countries, capturing the directional harmony of educational policy and economic outcomes rather than estimating causal strength or effect size. This allows them to generalize patterns of association in EU countries without overstating precision in cases where structural heterogeneity limits regression-based inference."

    "At the macroeconomic level, comparing the absolute magnitudes of GDP or vocational training costs across countries is problematic because these values are shaped by fundamentally different structural conditions. Each country varies in population size, wage structure, currency strength, level of economic maturity, and data reporting standards. These differences mean that even if two countries invest similar proportions of resources in training, the nominal amounts and resulting GDP values may differ dramatically. As a result, estimating a regression slope based on raw magnitudes would likely yield misleading or heterogeneous outcomes that reflect structural disparities rather than genuine economic relationships."

    "Given the available data for 2015 and 2020, the proposed research focuses on examining whether vocational training investment served as a buffer during the COVID-19 shock. While post-2020 recovery data are not available, it is still possible to assess shock resilience by analyzing whether countries with higher pre-pandemic vocational training expenditures experienced smaller GDP declines in 2020. In this framework, the x-variable represents the vocational training cost per employee in 2015 (or 2020, if more recent pre-pandemic data are available), while the y-variable measures GDP decline in 2020, calculated as the percentage change relative to the previous year. This approach allows the study to capture whether higher training levels contributed to countries’ ability to withstand sudden economic shocks."

    "To apply the Fechner correlation coefficient, GDP declines are transformed into a measure of resilience, where higher values indicate smaller losses or better shock absorption. The sign-based Fechner methodology then evaluates whether countries with above-average training investment tend to align with above-average resilience, and conversely, whether countries with below-average training correspond to below-average resilience. A positive Fechner correlation would indicate that pre-pandemic training investments were generally associated with better economic shock absorption, while a negative correlation would suggest the opposite."

    "This analysis provides a robust, cross-country perspective on the role of vocational training in macroeconomic stability during a crisis. By focusing on directional co-movement rather than the magnitude of effects, the study accounts for structural differences among countries, such as population size, wage levels, and economic maturity, which could distort traditional regression analyses. In this way, the research can offer insights into the potential of workforce development policies to enhance economic resilience in the face of large-scale shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic."
