    "The analysis presented in this study provides robust evidence that investments in vocational training (VCT) significantly enhance a country’s economic resilience. Using the GDP loss index and cross-country regression analysis, we find that higher VCT expenditure is associated with a measurable reduction in GDP losses during the COVID-19 shock. These results indicate that vocational training not only contributes to long-term economic growth through the development of human capital but also strengthens the capacity of economies to absorb and recover from unexpected crises."

    "Furthermore, the spatial patterns revealed by our map-based visualizations demonstrate that countries with consistently higher VCT investment tend to exhibit greater resilience, suggesting that targeted and sustained investments in workforce development can mitigate the severity of economic shocks. The findings also underscore the potential of VCT policies to reduce regional disparities in economic performance, particularly within the European Union, by equipping the labor force with adaptable skills that are valuable in times of crisis. Overall, this study highlights vocational training as a critical policy tool for enhancing macroeconomic stability, informing both national and supranational strategies aimed at fostering resilient and inclusive growth."
