    "The analysis presented in this study provides robust evidence that investments in vocational training (VCT) significantly enhance a country’s economic resilience. Using the GDP loss index and cross-country regression analysis, we find that higher VCT expenditure is associated with a measurable reduction in GDP losses during the COVID-19 shock. These results indicate that vocational training not only contributes to long-term economic growth through the development of human capital but also strengthens the capacity of economies to absorb and recover from unexpected crises."

    "Furthermore, the spatial patterns revealed by our map-based visualizations demonstrate that countries with consistently higher VCT investment tend to exhibit greater resilience, suggesting that targeted and sustained investments in workforce development can mitigate the severity of economic shocks. The findings also underscore the potential of VCT policies to reduce regional disparities in economic performance, particularly within the European Union, by equipping the labor force with adaptable skills that are valuable in times of crisis. Overall, this study highlights vocational training as a critical policy tool for enhancing macroeconomic stability, informing both national and supranational strategies aimed at fostering resilient and inclusive growth."

    "Next, the study evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 shock (Step 2), using the GDP loss index to quantify each country’s  economic vulnerability and recovery trajectory during the pandemic. Building on this, a regression model was developed and validated (Step 3) to estimate how variations in vocational training expenditure affect resilience. The results indicate that higher VCT investments are associated with measurable reductions in GDP losses, highlighting both the magnitude and direction of the effect.\n"

    "Finally, spatial and visual analyses (Step 4) revealed clear geographic patterns, showing that countries with sustained and substantial VCT investments exhibited stronger resilience. Together, these steps demonstrate that vocational training is not only a driver of long-term economic growth but also a critical mechanism for buffering economies against unexpected shocks. The findings underscore the policy relevance of targeted VCT programs as tools for enhancing macroeconomic stability and fostering more resilient, adaptive labor markets across the EU.

    "The findings of this study suggest that sustained investment in vocational training can serve as a strategic tool for enhancing economic resilience, particularly during unexpected crises such as pandemics. Policymakers at both national and EU levels should consider prioritizing VCT programs to support long-term productivity and mitigate the impact of economic shocks, while also addressing regional disparities in training intensity and access. For future research, extending the analysis to include additional dimensions of human capital, such as digital skills or lifelong learning, and conducting longitudinal or cross-regional studies could provide deeper insights into the causal mechanisms linking vocational training to macroeconomic stability. These avenues would further inform policies aimed at fostering resilient and adaptive labor markets. (Add a pragraph on polucy implication, and future research directions)"
