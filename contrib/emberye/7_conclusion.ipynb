    "The analysis presented in this study provides robust evidence that investments in vocational training (VCT) significantly enhance a country’s economic resilience. Using the GDP loss index and cross-country regression analysis, we find that higher VCT expenditure is associated with a measurable reduction in GDP losses during the COVID-19 shock. These results indicate that vocational training not only contributes to long-term economic growth through the development of human capital but also strengthens the capacity of economies to absorb and recover from unexpected crises."
