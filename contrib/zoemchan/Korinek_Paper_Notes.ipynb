    "# Six Domains of LLM Use in Economics\n",
    "Korinek organizes LLM (large language model) applications into six main domains:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideation & Feedback – Brainstorming research ideas, generating outlines, providing counterarguments, and giving written feedback or referee-style reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing – Drafting, editing, rephrasing, summarizing, and generating academic text (including abstracts, titles, and tweets).\n",
    "\n",
    "Background Research – Summarizing papers, explaining concepts, formatting or translating references, and conducting basic literature reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Analysis – Using LLMs (especially via plugins like ChatGPT’s Advanced Data Analysis) for regression, visualization, or data wrangling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding – Writing, debugging, or explaining code in multiple programming languages; automating repetitive coding tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical Derivations – Assisting with model setup, algebraic steps, and explaining derivations (still experimental)."

    "# ChatGPT (as a Research Tool)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Versions & Access:\n",
    "\n",
    "Free version uses GPT-3.5; paid ChatGPT Plus uses GPT-4 (more accurate, nuanced, and creative).\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-4 is currently the most powerful publicly available LLM and underpins many examples in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessible via web interface or API for reproducible, programmable workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Core Strengths for Economists:\n",
    "\n",
    "Automating “micro-tasks”: summarizing text, rewriting, brainstorming, formatting references, debugging code, generating graphs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing and editing research material (from drafts to abstracts, referee reports, or presentations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Explaining statistical, econometric, or programming concepts interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt Engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: The process of crafting effective prompts (instructions) to guide the LLM’s responses — essentially “programming in natural language.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide context (e.g., “I am an economist writing an academic paper on…”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specify tone or style (e.g., “Write in an academic but engaging style”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Set constraints (e.g., “Give three concise bullet points of 10 words each”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use role prompting: assign ChatGPT a persona (“Act as a research assistant specializing in econometrics”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: Start general, then refine — or use chain-of-thought prompting like “Think step-by-step.”\n",
    "\n",
    "## Iterative Interaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Korinek likens LLM use to working with an intern: smart, eager, but new to the project and prone to mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Productive workflow = provide context → review results → give corrections → re-prompt for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of iterative prompting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Brainstorm ideas → ask ChatGPT to evaluate them → ask it to refine the best one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Draft a section → request feedback → ask for edits to address that feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "This “dialogue loop” helps converge toward high-quality, context-aware outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patience and iteration yield outputs far superior to one-shot prompts."

    "# Plugins and Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Extend the core capabilities of ChatGPT beyond text generation — enabling data handling, computation, and integration with external tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Examples for Economists:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced Data Analysis (ADA) (ChatGPT Plus):\n",
    "\n",
    "Allows ChatGPT to write and execute Python code in a secure sandbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can upload datasets (e.g., CSV, Excel) for descriptive analysis, regressions, data cleaning, or file conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enables generation and modification of visualizations (charts, plots) within the chat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially functions as an on-demand coding + data assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wolfram Alpha Plugin:\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrates symbolic computation, mathematics, and data lookup capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful for performing exact calculations, generating plots, and checking analytical expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helps overcome ChatGPT’s weakness in mathematical precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Browser-enabled Models (e.g., Bing or Bard):\n",
    "\n",
    "These models can search the web in real time, providing up-to-date data and reference links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantageous for economic research that depends on recent statistics or literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude 2 (Anthropic):\n",
    "\n",
    "Has an enormous 100,000-token context window, allowing entire papers or books to be uploaded for detailed review or summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great for getting structured feedback, identifying strengths/weaknesses, and drafting referee-style reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vision-Language Extensions (VLMs):\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine visual and text understanding — promising for interpreting figures, tables, or handwritten notes in research workflows."

    "# Comparative Advantage and Limitations of AI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparative Advantage (Economic Insight):\n",
    "\n",
    "Korinek applies Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage to human–AI collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI systems excel at generating content: producing large amounts of text, summarizing, brainstorming, or simulating arguments rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans retain advantage in evaluating and organizing content — judging validity, setting research direction, and interpreting nuance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, productivity is maximized when:\n",
    "\n",
    "AI generates drafts, hypotheses, or analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans critically review, interpret, and decide which outputs are meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, as AI improves, the human role may shift toward meta-level tasks: defining research questions, validating outputs, and managing workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hallucination:\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs sometimes produce false or invented information (“confabulation”).\n",
    "\n",
    "They sound authoritative even when wrong — dangerous if users don’t verify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias and Ethics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data includes stereotypes and biases (e.g., gendered assumptions in occupations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Can reproduce or amplify these biases in generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy Concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "User input may be stored or used in retraining unless handled by privacy-protective models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important for confidential economic data or unpublished research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Cutoff and Limited Knowledge:\n",
    "\n",
    "Models like GPT-4 (as of 2023) only “know” up to 2021 data unless web-enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inconsistency and Reproducibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs can vary across runs due to stochastic sampling (even at temperature=0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Models and APIs evolve rapidly, making exact replication difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning Gaps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Still struggle with complex, multi-step logical reasoning or novel mathematical derivations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Korinek’s View:\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations make human oversight essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though LLMs sometimes err, their instantaneous responses and low transaction costs make them valuable for tasks too small to delegate to human assistants."
