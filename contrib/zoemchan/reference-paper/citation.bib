  abstract = {Heterogeneous agent models with multiple decisions are often  solved using inefficient grid search methods that require many  evaluations and are slow. This paper provides a novel method for  solving such models using an extension of the Endogenous Grid  Method (EGM) that uses Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to  interpolate functions on unstructured grids. First, I propose an  intuitive and strategic procedure for decomposing a problem into  subproblems which allows the use of efficient solution methods.  Second, using an exogenous grid of post-decision states and  solving for an endogenous grid of pre-decision states that obey a  first-order condition greatly speeds up the solution process.  Third, since the resulting endogenous grid can often be  non-rectangular at best and unstructured at worst, GPR provides  an efficient and accurate method for interpolating the value,  marginal value, and decision functions. Applied sequentially to  each decision within the problem, the method is able to solve  heterogeneous agent models with multiple decisions in a fraction  of the time and with less computational resources than are  required by standard methods currently used. Software to  reproduce these methods is available under the  \textbackslashhref\{https://econ-ark.org/\}\{\textbackslashtexttt\{Econ-ARK/HARK\}\}     project for the \textbackslashtexttt\{python\} programming  language.},
