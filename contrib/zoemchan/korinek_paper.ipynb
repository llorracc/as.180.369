    "In his paper, Korinek examines how artificial intelligence can assist in economic research and writing. He identifies six key areas where AI can contribute: ideation, writing, research, analysis, coding, and mathematical derivations. He also explains that as language models expand in scale and training data, new capabilities—such as translation, coding, and reasoning—emerge unexpectedly, illustrating how scaling enhances their usefulness for researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Korinek highlights ChatGPT as the most powerful publicly available large language model (LLM). For economists, it can automate micro-tasks, support writing and editing, and explain technical concepts interactively. Generative AI is especially valuable for small, repetitive tasks that are too minor to assign to human research assistants but collectively take significant time. To use ChatGPT effectively, Korinek introduces two key techniques: prompt engineering and iterative interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering involves crafting clear and detailed instructions to guide the model’s responses. Korinek recommends providing context, defining tone or role—for example, “I am an economist writing a research paper; respond in an academic tone”—and refining prompts based on feedback. Iterative interaction means engaging in a back-and-forth process of correction and improvement. He likens this to working with a new intern—intelligent and eager but inexperienced—where patience and feedback are essential to achieving high-quality results. As part of that, he explicitly notes that you can ask the AI to ask you clarifying questions — for example, to better understand your research goals, data, or the kind of output you want. Korinek suggests this as a way to make LLMs more effective collaborators: if you tell the model to “ask follow-up questions until you fully understand the task,” it helps the model gather context and produce more accurate, tailored results.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of my classmates observed that AI often produces overcomplicated models, requiring users to continually filter and redefine the boundaries of what the model should do. This insight aligns with Korinek’s emphasis on iterative interaction: large language models can easily overgenerate information or introduce unnecessary complexity if not guided carefully. To use AI effectively, researchers must actively refine prompts, simplify the model’s scope, and specify clear constraints—essentially teaching the AI what level of depth or focus is appropriate for the task. This process of setting boundaries ensures that the AI’s output remains relevant, manageable, and aligned with the researcher’s goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Korinek also discusses plugins and extensions that expand AI’s capabilities for economists. Examples include ChatGPT’s Advanced Data Analysis (ADA) tool, which executes Python code, analyzes datasets, and generates visualizations, and the Wolfram Alpha plugin, which performs exact mathematical computations. Other systems such as Claude 2 can process entire research papers with their large memory capacities, while web-connected tools like Bing Chat and Google Bard provide real-time access to up-to-date information. These extensions significantly broaden the research applications of AI, particularly in data analysis, coding, and mathematical modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Korinek explores the comparative advantage and limitations of AI. Drawing on Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage, he argues that AI excels at generating content, while humans are better at evaluating and organizing it. Productivity is highest when AI produces drafts, hypotheses, or analyses, and humans critically assess and refine them. However, AI systems also have limitations: they can produce false or fabricated information, reflect biases and stereotypes, show inconsistency, and struggle with complex reasoning. Privacy and ethical concerns about data use remain significant as well. Korinek cautions that it is both easy and dangerous to overestimate AI—because it can sound authoritative even when wrong—and to underestimate it, since its abilities are evolving rapidly. Overall, he concludes that although large language models are imperfect, their speed and low transaction costs make them valuable tools for automating small but time-consuming research tasks."
