    "In his paper, Korinek discussed the various ways that AI can be used to write economics papers. He first defined six ways that AI should be used when writing: ideation, writing, research, analysis, coding, and mathematical derivations. He then talks about the various forms of AI that are more widely used and discusses how they can be used. He explains that as language models grow larger and are trained on more data, new abilities, such as translation, coding, and reasoning, emerge suddenly, showing how improvements in scale lead to new applications for researchers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Korinek discusses ChatGPT, which is the most powerful publicly available LLM. For economists, he says it can be used for automating \"micro-tasks\", for writing and editing research material, and explaining concepts interactively. He emphasizes that generative AI is especially useful for small, repetitive tasks that are too minor to delegate to human research assistants but collectively consume significant time. When using LLMs like ChatGPT, he discusses the concepts of prompt engineering and iterative interaction. Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts (instructions) to guide the LLM’s responses. Korinek recommends providing clear context, specifying the desired tone or role—for example, “I am an economist writing a research paper; respond in an academic tone”—and refining prompts based on the model’s output. Iterative interaction is the need to provide feedback to AI and supply it with supplemental information to generate the best results. He likens this process to working with a new intern: intelligent and eager but inexperienced, meaning that patience and back-and-forth refinement are key to producing the best responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "He then goes on to discuss plugins and extensions which can constantly interact with you as you are on the computer. Korinek highlights examples such as ChatGPT’s Advanced Data Analysis (ADA) tool, which can execute Python code, analyze data files, and create visualizations, and the Wolfram Alpha plugin, which allows exact mathematical computation. Other systems like Claude 2 can read entire research papers with their large memory capacity, while web-connected tools like Bing Chat or Google Bard can search the internet in real time to provide up-to-date sources. These extensions significantly broaden what AI can do for economic research, especially in coding, data analysis, and mathematical problem solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Korinek then goes into the comparative advantage and limitations of AI. AI systems excel at generating content, but humans retain the advantage in evaluating and organizing content. Thus, productivity is maximized when AI generates drafts, hypotheses, or analyses and humans critically review, interpret, and decide which outputs are meaningful. While AI can be a very useful tool, it also has a lot of limitations like producing false or invented information, coded in biases and stereotypes, inconsistency, and reasoning gaps. there are also many privacy concerns with AI storing our data and ethical complications with its use. Korinek cautions that it is both easy and dangerous to overestimate AI, because it can sound authoritative even when wrong, and to underestimate it, since its capabilities are advancing rapidly with each new generation. Overall, Korinek believes that even though LLMs sometimes err, their instantaneous responses and low transaction costs make them valuable for tasks too small to delegate to human assistants."
