## HOLC History

The Home Owners’ Loan Corporation was created in 1933 as part of the New Deal’s effort to stabilize housing markets during the Great Depression. One of the agency’s most consequential undertakings was the creation of “residential security maps” that graded neighborhoods based on perceived credit risk. These grades—A (“Best”), B (“Still Desirable”), C (“Definitely Declining”), and D (“Hazardous”)—were based on a combination of housing conditions, socioeconomic characteristics, and, critically, racial composition (Hillier, 2003; Jackson, 1985). The resulting maps were color-coded, with “redlined” D-graded neighborhoods typically marked by higher concentrations of Black residents, immigrants, and working-class populations.

Although the HOLC’s stated purpose was to assess mortgage risk, its appraisal practices institutionalized racial prejudice within federal lending policy (Crossney & Bartelt, 2005; Michney & Winling, 2020). HOLC assessors drew on local realtors and bankers who frequently described racial “infiltration” as a cause for neighborhood decline, embedding racial and ethnic bias into the official record (Hillier, 2003). These maps were subsequently used by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and private lenders to restrict mortgage credit, further entrenching patterns of segregation and disinvestment (Greer, 2012; Aaronson et al., 2021).

While scholars debate whether the HOLC itself originated redlining or simply reflected existing racial divisions (Fishback, Rose, & Snowden, 2021), there is broad consensus that its maps shaped the geography of opportunity for generations. They provided a federally sanctioned template that justified unequal investment, influencing where banks lent, where infrastructure developed, and where families could accumulate wealth (Appel & Nickerson, 2016). By codifying racial risk into financial decision-making, the HOLC helped institutionalize the spatial segregation that continues to define American cities today.

## Modern Outcomes of HOLC

Over the past decade, researchers have connected the geography of redlining to a wide range of contemporary social and economic disparities. Using digitized HOLC maps, scholars have shown that formerly redlined areas continue to exhibit lower home values, lower household incomes, and higher racial segregation (Aaronson et al., 2021; Appel & Nickerson, 2016; Krimmel, 2018). Beyond housing, these areas also show worse environmental and health outcomes—they experience higher exposure to air pollution, urban heat, and chronic disease (Hoffman et al., 2020; Nardone et al., 2020; Namin et al., 2020).

Importantly, redlining’s effects extend into the educational domain. Lukes and Cleveland (2021) provide one of the first comprehensive analyses linking HOLC grades to school funding, diversity, and academic performance. They find that schools located in formerly redlined neighborhoods receive significantly less per-pupil revenue, enroll more racially homogeneous student bodies, and have lower average test scores. These findings suggest that historical redlining has a durable influence on the distribution of educational resources, even after controlling for contemporary socioeconomic conditions.

Other scholars echo these patterns. Aaronson et al. (2021) find persistent disparities in property values and income across HOLC boundaries, implying that local tax bases—and thus school funding—remain affected. Faber (2021) demonstrates that redlining amplified racial wealth gaps by shaping who benefited from mid-century housing subsidies. Collectively, this literature portrays redlining as a foundational mechanism linking historical racial exclusion to contemporary inequality across multiple domains. Yet despite growing recognition of redlining’s educational consequences, few studies directly examine whether its legacy extends to STEM coursework access, an increasingly important dimension of academic opportunity and future labor market participation.

## The Relationship Between Schools, Neighborhoods, and Student Outcomes

Education systems are deeply intertwined with neighborhood contexts. In the United States, school funding structures rely heavily on local property taxes, meaning that differences in neighborhood wealth directly translate into differences in educational resources (Jackson, Johnson, & Persico, 2016; Lafortune, Rothstein, & Schanzenbach, 2018). Because redlining constrained homeownership and suppressed property values in Black and immigrant neighborhoods, it indirectly limited the fiscal capacity of their local schools. Decades of research show that school resources matter for long-term outcomes: districts that received funding increases after school-finance reforms saw higher graduation rates and adult earnings among low-income students (Jackson et al., 2016).

Neighborhood effects extend beyond funding. Residential segregation—reinforced by redlining—shapes peer composition, teacher quality, and access to advanced coursework (Reardon et al., 2019; Owens, 2018). Students in racially and economically segregated schools have fewer opportunities to take advanced placement (AP) courses and less exposure to high-level math and science curricula (Card & Giuliano, 2016). Because STEM course access is a strong predictor of postsecondary achievement and STEM degree completion, these early disparities have compounding effects on social mobility (Maltese & Tai, 2011).

Neighborhood opportunity also influences long-term life trajectories. Chetty and Hendren (2018a, 2018b) show that children who grow up in higher-opportunity neighborhoods—defined by income mobility and school quality—achieve higher adult earnings and educational attainment. Historical redlining shaped these neighborhood opportunity structures, meaning that children today may still inherit the consequences of 1930s credit maps through the schools available to them. By examining whether schools in formerly redlined areas are less likely to offer advanced STEM courses, this study extends existing work on redlining and education to a new dimension of academic inequality.

Ultimately, the literature suggests that the HOLC’s spatial imprint remains visible in today’s educational landscape. Schools continue to reflect the socioeconomic contours of the neighborhoods they serve, and those contours were, in part, drawn nearly a century ago by federal policy. By linking historical redlining to modern STEM access, this paper provides new evidence on how spatially embedded inequalities continue to constrain pathways into high-opportunity fields, reinforcing intergenerational disparities in human capital formation.
