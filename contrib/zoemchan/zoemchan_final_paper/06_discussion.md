The results provide evidence that historical redlining continues to shape access to advanced STEM coursework, particularly along the intensive margin. Nationally, schools located in historically C- and D-rated neighborhoods are not only less likely to offer any advanced STEM course but also offer fewer distinct advanced STEM subjects. These findings suggest that educational disparities linked to redlining operate through reductions in curricular depth rather than complete exclusion from STEM instruction.

One plausible mechanism underlying these patterns is the persistence of fiscal and institutional constraints in historically disinvested neighborhoods. Because school funding in the United States remains closely tied to local property values, neighborhoods that experienced decades of suppressed homeownership and investment may continue to face resource limitations that restrict the ability to staff and sustain advanced coursework. Advanced STEM classes, particularly physics and computer science, often require specialized teachers and smaller class sizes, making them especially sensitive to budget constraints.

Teacher labor market dynamics may further reinforce these disparities. Schools in historically marginalized neighborhoods may face greater difficulty attracting and retaining teachers with specialized STEM credentials, leading administrators to prioritize core graduation requirements over advanced offerings. Over time, these staffing challenges can become self-reinforcing as limited course availability reduces student demand and institutional justification for expanding advanced programs.

City-level heterogeneity highlights the importance of local context in mediating these mechanisms. In Chicago and Detroit—cities characterized by long-standing residential segregation and relatively stable neighborhood boundaries—the relationship between HOLC grade and STEM access closely mirrors the national pattern. In contrast, Los Angeles exhibits weaker and sometimes reversed associations. This divergence may reflect the city’s distinct educational geography, including the concentration of magnet and specialized schools in historically lower-rated neighborhoods and substantial postwar development that weakened the alignment between HOLC boundaries and present-day school resources.

Alternative explanations must also be considered. Measurement error in historical boundaries or contemporary course reporting could attenuate estimated effects, particularly in cities with fewer A-rated neighborhoods. Additionally, selective school placement—such as the siting of magnet programs in historically disadvantaged areas—could bias estimates upward in some contexts, as appears plausible in Los Angeles. While the boundary discontinuity design mitigates many confounding factors, it cannot fully account for all post-HOLC policy interventions that reshaped local educational landscapes.

From a policy perspective, these findings suggest that addressing educational inequality requires attention not only to student access but also to the depth of curricular offerings. Policies aimed at expanding advanced STEM coursework in historically disadvantaged neighborhoods—such as targeted funding for specialized teachers or incentives for advanced course development—may help disrupt the persistence of historically rooted disparities. Importantly, the heterogeneity observed across cities indicates that such interventions must be tailored to local institutional contexts rather than applied uniformly.
