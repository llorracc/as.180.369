    "### Distribution of Advanced STEM Access\n",
    "\n",
    "I begin by documenting how access to advanced STEM coursework is distributed across schools located near historical HOLC boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 presents the percent of schools offering zero to three advanced STEM subjects—calculus, computer science, and physics—by HOLC grade. A clear and monotonic pattern emerges. Schools located in historically A-rated neighborhoods are substantially more likely to offer a full complement of advanced STEM courses, while schools in lower-rated areas are increasingly concentrated among those offering few or no such courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In A-rated neighborhoods, nearly half of schools offer all three advanced STEM subjects, whereas only about one-fifth of schools in D-rated neighborhoods do so. Conversely, the share of schools offering no advanced STEM courses rises steadily as HOLC grade worsens, increasing from roughly 21 percent in A-rated areas to nearly 27 percent in D-rated areas. These shifts indicate that disparities in STEM access operate not only through whether advanced coursework is offered at all, but through systematic differences in curricular breadth."

    "### Summary of National Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Across the national sample of high schools located near historical HOLC boundaries, the legacy of redlining remains clearly visible in access to advanced STEM education. Descriptive evidence shows a consistent redistribution of schools away from offering a full suite of advanced STEM courses and toward offering few or none as HOLC grades worsen. Regression estimates confirm that these patterns persist after accounting for observable school characteristics and local context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the effects of redlining are far more pronounced along the intensive margin than the extensive margin. While the probability of offering any advanced STEM coursework declines modestly from A- to D-rated neighborhoods, the breadth of STEM offerings falls sharply. This suggests that historical housing discrimination continues to shape not just whether STEM opportunities exist, but the depth and quality of those opportunities—an outcome with meaningful implications for students’ college readiness and long-term access to STEM careers."

    "To complement the national analysis, I examine how the relationship between historical HOLC grades and advanced STEM course offerings appears within four large, historically redlined metropolitan areas: Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Detroit. These cities were selected because each contains at least three neighborhoods of every HOLC grade and each has substantial variation in school locations relative to HOLC boundaries. As in the national design, I restrict the analysis to high schools located within 0.25 miles of a historical redlining boundary to ensure that comparisons are made across locally similar areas. The goal of this section is not to compare cities to one another, but rather to evaluate whether the patterns observed nationally also hold within individual urban contexts, and to understand where and why deviations may occur."

Philadelphia exhibits a similar but less pronounced gradient, in part because fewer schools are located in A-rated neighborhoods within the 0.25-mile boundary sample.

Los Angeles once again diverges: averages for C- and D-rated neighborhoods are similar to—or in some cases higher than—those in A- or B-rated areas. This contrasts sharply with the national pattern shown earlier in Figure 3, where declines from A to D are smooth and sizable.\n",

The first column reports the effect of redlining on the probability that a school offers at least one advanced STEM course (Any STEM). The second column reports the effect on the total number of advanced STEM courses offered. Negative coefficients indicate reduced STEM access in C/D zones. Chicago and Detroit display large negative effects consistent with national patterns, Philadelphia shows smaller and imprecise effects, and Los Angeles exhibits positive coefficients, reflecting the city’s unique distribution of magnet and specialized schools in lower-rated historical zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across cities, Chicago and Detroit show strong negative associations between redlining and STEM access. In Chicago, schools in C/D neighborhoods are 17.4 percentage points less likely to offer any advanced STEM course, and they offer 6.05 fewer courses in total. Detroit displays even larger effects: a 28.3–percentage point reduction in the probability of offering any advanced STEM and a striking 24.5-course deficit in total offerings. These magnitudes exceed the national estimates and suggest that historical neighborhood ratings continue to strongly shape educational opportunity in cities where economic and demographic segregation remain especially pronounced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Philadelphia’s binary redline effects are small and statistically inconsistent in magnitude (−2.29 to +8.39), echoing the ambiguity in the descriptive plots. This is likely explained by the limited number of schools in A-rated neighborhoods within the boundary sample—many HOLC A areas in Philadelphia were historically smaller and more residential, resulting in fewer present-day high schools. As a result, estimates for A to D comparisons are noisier and less stable than in Chicago or Detroit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Los Angeles is the only city where both coefficients point in the opposite direction of national patterns. Schools in historically redlined areas are estimated to be slightly more likely to offer any advanced STEM course (+7.9 percentage points) and to offer more STEM courses overall (+2.42). Importantly, this does not necessarily imply that redlining “reversed” in Los Angeles. Rather, it reflects two structural features of the city: (1) extensive postwar suburban expansion that altered the distribution of school types relative to HOLC boundaries, and (2) a concentration of magnet and specialized high schools in historically lower-rated central LA neighborhoods. These institutional dynamics mean that HOLC boundaries in Los Angeles align less cleanly with present-day school resources than in the more rigidly segregated Midwestern and Northeastern cities.\n",

Chicago and Detroit again show monotonic declines across B, C, and D categories for both AnySTEM and TotalSTEM outcomes, mirroring the national gradient.

    "### Comparison to National Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, the city-level analyses demonstrate that the national results are not driven solely by one or two metropolitan areas. Chicago and Detroit closely replicate the national pattern: schools in historically redlined areas offer significantly fewer STEM classes and are less likely to offer any at all. Philadelphia shows muted effects due to small sample sizes in top-rated areas, but its qualitative direction aligns with the national trend. Los Angeles, by contrast, deviates from both the national pattern and the other cities—largely due to the city’s distinct educational geography, including widespread magnet programs located disproportionately in lower-rated HOLC areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these results suggest that redlining’s educational legacy is robust at a broad scale, yet its local manifestation varies depending on how historical boundaries intersect with postwar development, school-choice ecosystems, and district-level reforms. In cities with stable neighborhood structures (Chicago, Detroit), the HOLC gradient remains a powerful predictor of STEM access. In cities with significant postwar transformation (Los Angeles) or limited A-rated coverage (Philadelphia), the relationship becomes more diffuse. Nonetheless, even in these cases, descriptive patterns still show disparities in STEM depth across neighborhoods, consistent with broader structural inequalities."
