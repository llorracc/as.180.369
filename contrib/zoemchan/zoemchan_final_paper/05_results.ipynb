    "I begin by documenting how access to advanced STEM coursework is distributed across schools located near historical HOLC boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 presents the percent of schools offering zero to three advanced STEM subjects—calculus, computer science, and physics—by HOLC grade. A clear and monotonic pattern emerges. Schools located in historically A-rated neighborhoods are substantially more likely to offer a full complement of advanced STEM courses, while schools in lower-rated areas are increasingly concentrated among those offering few or no such courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In A-rated neighborhoods, nearly half of schools offer all three advanced STEM subjects, whereas only about one-fifth of schools in D-rated neighborhoods do so. Conversely, the share of schools offering no advanced STEM courses rises steadily as HOLC grade worsens, increasing from roughly 21 percent in A-rated areas to nearly 27 percent in D-rated areas. These shifts indicate that disparities in STEM access operate not only through whether advanced coursework is offered at all, but through systematic differences in curricular breadth."

    "Across the national sample of high schools located near historical HOLC boundaries, the legacy of redlining remains clearly visible in access to advanced STEM education. Descriptive evidence shows a consistent redistribution of schools away from offering a full suite of advanced STEM courses and toward offering few or none as HOLC grades worsen. Regression estimates confirm that these patterns persist after accounting for observable school characteristics and local context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the effects of redlining are far more pronounced along the intensive margin than the extensive margin. While the probability of offering any advanced STEM coursework declines modestly from A- to D-rated neighborhoods, the breadth of STEM offerings falls sharply. This suggests that historical housing discrimination continues to shape not just whether STEM opportunities exist, but the depth and quality of those opportunities—an outcome with meaningful implications for students’ college readiness and long-term access to STEM careers."

    "Taken together, the city-level analyses demonstrate that the national relationship between historical redlining and advanced STEM access is not driven by a single metropolitan area. Chicago and Detroit closely replicate the national pattern, with large and persistent reductions in both the likelihood and breadth of advanced STEM offerings in historically lower-rated neighborhoods. Philadelphia shows weaker and less precise effects, largely due to sample limitations rather than an absence of underlying disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Los Angeles represents a meaningful departure from the national trend. Rather than indicating a reversal of redlining’s effects, this divergence likely reflects the city’s distinct educational geography, including extensive postwar development and the concentration of magnet and specialized schools in historically lower-rated central neighborhoods. These institutional features weaken the alignment between historical HOLC boundaries and present-day school resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the city-level results reinforce the conclusion that redlining’s educational legacy is robust but locally contingent. In cities with stable neighborhood structures and persistent segregation, historical housing discrimination continues to shape access to advanced STEM education. Where urban development and school placement have evolved more dramatically, the relationship becomes more diffuse, though disparities in STEM depth remain evident."
