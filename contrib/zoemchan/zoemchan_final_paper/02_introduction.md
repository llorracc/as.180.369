# Introduction
Historical redlining policies in the United States have had persistent and far-reaching effects on the spatial distribution of opportunity. The Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC), established in 1933 to stabilize the housing market during the Great Depression, produced residential security maps that assigned neighborhoods grades from “A” (best) to “D” (hazardous). Although these maps were not the sole source of housing discrimination, they codified pre-existing racial and socioeconomic hierarchies into a formal system that shaped credit access, property values, and public investment for decades. Subsequent research has demonstrated that the HOLC’s racialized risk assessments not only influenced housing markets but also reinforced patterns of urban inequality that continue to structure access to opportunity today ({cite}`Aaronson2021-xr`; {cite}`Lukes2021-va`). 

This paper investigates whether the geography of redlining continues to shape access to advanced science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) coursework in American public schools. Access to advanced STEM education—such as calculus, physics, chemistry, and computer science—plays a crucial role in determining students’ college readiness and long-term economic mobility. Yet opportunity to pursue these subjects remains unequally distributed across schools and neighborhoods. While prior studies have linked redlined neighborhoods to disparities in housing, health, and environmental outcomes ({cite}`Appel2016-rl`; {cite}`Hoffman2020-aq`; {cite}`Nardone2021-ft`), few have examined whether redlining continues to shape educational opportunity in the domain of STEM.

Despite a growing body of evidence connecting historical redlining to modern socioeconomic outcomes, an important gap remains in understanding how these legacies manifest in educational opportunity structures, particularly in high-value academic areas like STEM. Existing studies—such as {cite}`Lukes2021-va`—demonstrate that redlined neighborhoods are associated with lower school funding, less diversity, and weaker student performance, but they focus primarily on overall achievement metrics. This paper extends that literature by examining STEM coursework access as a distinct and policy-relevant outcome that connects neighborhood history to long-term economic opportunity. Since STEM fields drive much of the modern labor market’s wage growth and innovation, disparities in early access to STEM preparation perpetuate the broader racial and socioeconomic inequalities that redlining helped create. Identifying whether these disparities follow historical redlining boundaries can inform education policy and equity initiatives aimed at mitigating structural barriers to mobility.

To address this question, the study employs a boundary discontinuity design inspired by {cite}`Aaronson2021-xr`. Schools located within 0.25 miles of historical HOLC boundaries are compared across adjacent neighborhoods that received different HOLC grades. This approach isolates the local effects of redlining by holding constant broader city-level factors while accounting for modern neighborhood differences. The analysis proceeds in three parts. First, a national analysis is conducted across 113 metropolitan areas with at least three distinct HOLC zones (A–D) to estimate the average relationship between redlining and STEM access. Second, the study performs localized analyses for four major cities—Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Detroit—to explore regional variation in how redlining’s legacy interacts with contemporary urban contexts. Together, these analyses aim to provide the first systematic evidence on whether the legacy of redlining extends to inequalities in advanced STEM education, highlighting how historical structures of exclusion continue to shape the geography of educational opportunity.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The Literature Review provides historical background on the HOLC program, summarizes recent research on the modern consequences of redlining, and discusses the link between neighborhood context and educational outcomes. The Methods section outlines the empirical framework, including the boundary discontinuity design and estimation strategy. The Data section describes the sources used in the analysis, including the HOLC maps and Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC). The Results section presents findings from the national and city-level analyses, while the Discussion interprets these results in light of policy implications and the broader literature on educational inequality. Finally, the Conclusion summarizes the key insights and identifies directions for future research on the long-term educational legacies of redlining.
