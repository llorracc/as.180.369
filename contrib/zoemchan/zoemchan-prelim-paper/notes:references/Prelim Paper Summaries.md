## [The lingering legacy of redlining on school funding, diversity, and performance; Lukes & Cleveland, 2021](https://edworkingpapers.com/ai21-363)

Lukes and Cleveland (2021) investigate how historic redlining practices, carried out through the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) maps of the 1930s and 1940s, continue to shape educational outcomes in the United States. Using a spatial analysis of 144 metropolitan areas, the authors link historically redlined neighborhoods (graded “D”) to present-day school funding, student demographics, and performance. They find that schools in formerly redlined areas receive less per-pupil funding from local sources, enroll larger shares of Black and non-White students, are less racially diverse overall, and score lower on standardized math and reading assessments compared to schools in higher-rated (A–C) neighborhoods. These disparities persist across regions and remain statistically significant even after controlling for local variation. Moreover, longitudinal analysis shows that while school funding and performance have generally improved over time, the gaps between redlined and non-redlined areas have widened, underscoring the persistent influence of historical segregation.

The findings are especially important for research on STEM outcomes, as inequities in school funding and diversity directly shape access to advanced coursework, qualified teachers, and extracurricular opportunities in math and science. By documenting the persistent resource and achievement gaps tied to redlining, Lukes and Cleveland provide evidence of how historical housing discrimination constrains educational opportunities across generations. For STEM specifically, this suggests that students in historically redlined neighborhoods may be less likely to access the rigorous preparation needed to succeed in science and engineering fields. The study highlights that to address underrepresentation in STEM, policymakers must also confront the structural legacies of redlining that continue to limit educational opportunity in disadvantaged neighborhoods.


## [The legacy of structural racism: Associations between historic redlining, current mortgage lending, and health; Lynch, 2021](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy1.library.jhu.edu/science/article/pii/S2352827321000689?via%3Dihub)

Lynch et al. (2021) examine how historic redlining continues to shape present-day neighborhood conditions by focusing on Milwaukee, one of the most segregated metropolitan areas in the U.S. Using Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) maps from the 1930s combined with 2018 mortgage lending data, they created a “lending trajectory” measure that captured both historic disinvestment and current lending discrimination. The study finds that census tracts with high historic redlining scores are significantly more likely to experience present-day lending discrimination, including fewer originated loans and higher rates of costly loans. These same tracts show higher poverty, lower household income, and reduced educational attainment, along with larger Black and Hispanic populations compared to areas that were not redlined. Importantly, the study also documents a graded relationship between disinvestment and negative health outcomes—tracts with sustained disinvestment report worse self-reported physical and mental health.

For my focus on STEM outcomes, the relevance lies in the way redlining constrained neighborhood investment over generations. The study demonstrates how structural racism in housing shaped wealth accumulation, education levels, and neighborhood resources. These systemic deficits likely extend to schooling environments, meaning fewer resources for advanced coursework, underfunded STEM programs, and reduced access to opportunity. While the authors focus on health, their framework highlights how redlining operates as an upstream determinant of multiple inequalities. Just as they find lasting health consequences, the same mechanisms—restricted mortgage access, depressed property values, and chronic disinvestment—could plausibly explain enduring disparities in access to STEM education and pathways into STEM fields.


## [Diversity & Stem; 2023](file:///Users/zoechan/Downloads/redlining%20papers/nsf23315-report%20-%20nsf23315-report.pdf)

The NSF report (2023) documents that underrepresented minorities—including Hispanics, Blacks, and American Indians or Alaska Natives—remain significantly underrepresented in both STEM education and the STEM workforce relative to their share of the U.S. population. For example, these groups made up 37% of the U.S. college-age population in 2021 but only 26% of science and engineering (S&E) bachelor’s, 24% of master’s, and 16% of doctoral degree recipients. Representation gaps are particularly wide in engineering: in 2020, Black students earned 12% of bachelor’s degrees in social sciences but only 5% in engineering, underscoring how barriers in access to rigorous math and science preparation reduce entry into engineering-intensive pathways.

In the workforce, disparities mirror these educational gaps. In 2021, underrepresented minorities made up 24% of the total STEM workforce but were disproportionately concentrated in middle-skill occupations, such as technical support or skilled trades, which typically do not require a bachelor’s degree. Only 16% of S&E occupations requiring a bachelor’s degree or higher were filled by underrepresented minorities, compared to much higher shares for Whites and Asians. These findings show how educational inequities cascade into workforce underrepresentation. If historically redlined neighborhoods today still experience lower school funding and fewer advanced STEM opportunities (as studies like Lukes & Cleveland 2021 suggest), that structural legacy helps explain why students from those neighborhoods are less likely to pursue high-skill STEM degrees and occupations, perpetuating racial and socioeconomic disparities in STEM fields.


## [The Effects of the 1930s HOLC Redlining Maps; Aaronson, 2021](file:///Users/zoechan/Downloads/redlining%20papers/aaronson-et-al-2021-the-effects-of-the-1930s-holc-redlining-maps.pdf)

Aaronson et al. (2021) examine the causal impact of the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) “redlining” maps on neighborhood outcomes from the 1930s onward. They find that neighborhoods graded as “C” (yellow) and especially “D” (red) experienced persistent declines in homeownership, housing values, and credit access compared to otherwise similar areas. Importantly, these differences did not exist prior to the maps but emerged afterward, indicating that the HOLC grades themselves influenced disinvestment rather than simply reflecting pre-existing conditions. Their results suggest that redlining had a powerful and lasting impact on neighborhood socioeconomic trajectories, contributing to long-run racial wealth gaps and spatial inequality.


## [The Long-Run Effects of the 1930s HOLC Redlining Maps on Children; Aaronson, 2022](file:///Users/zoechan/Downloads/redlining%20papers/LR%20effects%20of%20redlining%20on%20children_aaronson.pdf)

Aaronson et al. (2022) study how the 1930s HOLC redlining maps influenced the life trajectories of children who grew up in affected neighborhoods. Using linked census and administrative data, they compare children raised in neighborhoods on the lower-rated side of HOLC map boundaries to those just across the border. The study finds that children who grew up in redlined areas had significantly worse long-term outcomes, including lower adult income, higher likelihood of incarceration, and reduced educational attainment. Importantly, these differences were not present before the maps were drawn but emerged afterward, providing strong causal evidence that redlining itself shaped intergenerational opportunity gaps.

The implications for STEM are clear: if redlining lowered educational attainment overall, it likely also restricted pathways into resource-intensive fields like engineering and science, which require access to advanced math and science coursework early on. By depressing local property values and weakening school funding, redlining would have reduced opportunities for rigorous academic preparation, making it less likely that children from these neighborhoods entered STEM fields later in life. This study thus provides direct evidence that the legacy of redlining extends beyond housing markets into the human capital formation of children, supporting the idea that redlining continues to shape disparities in STEM education and careers today.
