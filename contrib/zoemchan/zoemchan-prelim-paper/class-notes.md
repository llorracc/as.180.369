# Notes

- format methodology into proper form & come up with a regression
- decide on confounding variables and pull them in
- remove charter and magnet schools and rerun regression
- run a focus on chicago, philly, detroit, LA. explain lack of NCY use due to their school system
    - make summary tables for each city and national? maybe better to give more specific analysis for international 
- work on graphs for making data more readable and meaningful 
    - map: redo colors to increase readbility. change dots to rep 0,1,2,3 courses
    - clarify what HOLC grades mean
    - change dot plot
