# Methodology

## Data
Redlining data was obtained from the university of Richmond's mapping inequality project. The original maps are all from City Survey Files, 1935-1940 at the National Archives with two exceptions. The San Antonio map is from the University of Texas, San Antonio Special Collections and the Portland, Maine, map from Bowdoin College. Richmond then digitized these redlining maps. Data on classes and confounding variables were all obtained from 2021-22 CRCD education files.
