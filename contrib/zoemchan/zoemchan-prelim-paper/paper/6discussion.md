This paper provides new evidence that the legacy of historical redlining continues to shape access to advanced STEM coursework in American high schools. Using a boundary discontinuity design across 113 HOLC-mapped cities and a more detailed set of case studies in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles, the results demonstrate that schools located in historically lower-rated neighborhoods systematically offer fewer advanced STEM opportunities than schools in higher-rated areas located just across the same historical boundaries. While the magnitude of the effects varies across cities, the national pattern is robust: both the likelihood of offering any advanced STEM course and the total number of STEM subjects offered decline steadily from HOLC A → D neighborhoods.

The descriptive evidence makes these patterns especially clear. Nationally, the steepest differences emerge in the depth of course offerings, with A-rated areas offering far more calculus, computer science, and physics courses than D-rated areas. Importantly, these differences persist within narrow 0.25-mile boundary zones, where the physical environment, tax districts, and broader municipal services are otherwise quite similar. These patterns suggest that redlining’s legacy continues to operate through long-run differences in neighborhood investment and school-level resource accumulation, even long after HOLC maps ceased to hold formal authority.

The city-level analyses provide further insight into how these national patterns manifest—not uniformly, but in ways shaped by local educational ecosystems. Chicago and Detroit both closely mirror the national gradient. These cities have long-standing housing segregation, persistent school funding disparities, and neighborhood infrastructures that remain strongly correlated with historical HOLC ratings. In these contexts, redlining’s imprint appears directly in today’s distribution of advanced STEM opportunities. Schools in C- and D-rated areas are less likely to offer any STEM coursework, and they offer substantially fewer classes overall—effects that are often larger in magnitude than the national estimates.

Philadelphia follows a similar directional trend, but with weaker and more volatile estimates. The city’s boundary sample contains relatively few schools in A-rated neighborhoods, which limits statistical precision. Nonetheless, the descriptive maps and average-course plots still show reduced STEM depth in lower-rated areas. This pattern supports the idea that the relationship between redlining and STEM access is widespread, even if its strength varies based on local school density, district organization, and neighborhood development.

Los Angeles is the main exception. Its schools show little to no decline—and in some cases modest increases—in advanced STEM offerings when moving from A- to D-rated neighborhoods. This divergence does not contradict the national pattern but instead illustrates how local educational institutions can alter or weaken the influence of historical redlining. Los Angeles has a unique distribution of specialized, magnet, and STEM-focused high schools that are disproportionately located in formerly C- and D-rated areas of the city’s central basin. In this context, present-day school placement reflects more recent district reforms rather than the spatial logic of the 1930s HOLC maps. The LA case underscores that the legacy of redlining interacts with the postwar evolution of urban school systems, and that contemporary policies can either reinforce—or partially override—historical patterns.

Together, the results point to three broader conclusions. First, redlining’s educational legacy operates on both the extensive margin (whether a school offers any advanced STEM coursework) and the intensive margin (how many STEM subjects a school can support). The latter relationship is particularly strong and has important implications for STEM readiness and college trajectories. Second, while the national pattern is clear and consistent, cities differ in how strongly historical boundaries map onto present-day educational inequality—reflecting differences in school district reforms, program placement, demographic shifts, and urban development. Third, the strongest city-level effects appear in places where neighborhood disadvantage remained closely tied to mid-century patterns of segregation, suggesting that redlining’s impact is most persistent where structural inequalities have compounded over time.

Although this study does not directly evaluate policy interventions, the findings point toward several areas where targeted action may help narrow opportunity gaps. Briefly, districts may consider prioritizing advanced STEM expansion in lower-rated HOLC areas, reviewing magnet and specialty program placement for equity implications, and strengthening teacher training pipelines for schools serving historically disadvantaged neighborhoods. These strategies are not substitutes for broader structural reforms, but they may help mitigate some of the persistent inequalities uncovered in this analysis.

Overall, the results highlight that the geography of advanced educational opportunity in the United States is still deeply connected to its historical landscape. Understanding how these patterns emerged, and why they persist or weaken across different local contexts, is essential for designing policies that meaningfully expand STEM access for students in all communities.
