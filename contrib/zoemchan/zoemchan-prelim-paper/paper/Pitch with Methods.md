# Pitch

Redlining, formalized through the Home Owners‚Äô Loan Corporation (HOLC) maps of the 1930s, has been shown to exert enduring effects on neighborhood wealth, credit access, and education. Aaronson, Hartley, and Mazumder (2021) provide causal evidence that neighborhoods graded ‚ÄúC‚Äù and ‚ÄúD‚Äù experienced declines in homeownership, housing values, and credit access relative to adjacent, higher-rated areas. Extending this work, Aaronson et al. (2022) demonstrate that children raised in redlined neighborhoods had significantly worse long-term outcomes, including lower educational attainment and adult earnings, compared to those raised just across boundary lines. These findings highlight how redlining not only depressed asset values but also constrained intergenerational opportunities, suggesting an indirect pathway through which access to resource-intensive educational tracks, such as those leading to STEM fields, may have been curtailed.

Empirical evidence supports this link between redlining, school funding, and educational opportunity. Lukes and Cleveland (2021) show that schools located in historically redlined neighborhoods continue to receive less per-pupil funding, enroll larger shares of minority students, and post lower standardized test scores in math and reading compared to schools in higher-graded areas. Lynch et al. (2021) similarly find that historically redlined neighborhoods are associated with higher poverty, lower income, and reduced educational attainment, reinforcing the persistence of educational disadvantage. Since U.S. schools are primarily funded through local property taxes, depressed property values in redlined areas directly translate into reduced school resources, fewer advanced courses, and limited access to specialized science and math instruction. These structural barriers map closely onto the preparation needed for students to pursue postsecondary STEM degrees.

National statistics underscore how such disparities play out in STEM pathways. According to the NSF‚Äôs 2023 Diversity and STEM report, Black and Hispanic students comprise 37% of the U.S. college-age population but earn only 26% of science and engineering bachelor‚Äôs degrees, with even sharper underrepresentation in engineering. Workforce gaps mirror these patterns, as underrepresented minorities make up 24% of the labor force but hold only 16% of bachelor‚Äôs-level STEM jobs. Taken together, these studies suggest that the legacy of redlining plausibly contributes to the underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic students in STEM by shaping access to rigorous STEM preparation in K‚Äì12 schools. Testing this hypothesis would involve merging digitized HOLC map data (Mapping Inequality) with modern education data, such as the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) on advanced coursework access and the American Community Survey (ACS) on field-of-degree attainment, and applying boundary discontinuity designs akin to Aaronson et al. (2021). Such an approach could provide direct evidence of whether historically redlined neighborhoods remain disadvantaged in producing STEM opportunities, extending the literature on structural racism into the domain of STEM education and workforce equity.

# Methods

Compare neighborhoods (or schools) immediately on either side of HOLC map boundaries to estimate whether historically lower-rated HOLC areas (C/D) have lower present-day STEM access (advanced math/science course availability, AP STEM offerings). Use boundary buffers + nearby comparison boundaries (propensity-weighted) to address pre-existing differences ‚Äî essentially following Aaronson et al. (2021).

## Outcome

Y: school level indicator
- Share of students with access to calculus / physics / AP science / AP CS (from CRDC or state course catalogs).
- Binary: school offers AP calculus / AP physics / computer science (1/0).

## Independent Variable

REDLINE(treatment): indicator = 1 if geographic unit g lies on the lower-graded side of an HOLC boundary (C or D)

## Contemporary cross section

Y=Œ±+Œ≤REDLINE+XŒ≥+Œ¥+Œ∑+Œµ
- Œ¥: city / CBSA fixed effects (compare within metro areas).
- ùúÇ: boundary fixed effect if using buffer pairs. If you use a border approach, ùúÇ will be the same across the two sides and absorbs many local confounders.
- Œ≤ estimates the association between historical HOLC grade and present STEM access controlling for observed covariates and local unobservables.

## Controls

- Median household income (ACS), poverty rate.
- % Black, % Hispanic, % foreign-born.
- % adults with BA or higher (to capture contemporaneous education).
- Population density / urbanicity indicator.
- School/district-level per-pupil funding (NCES CCD / state finance data).
- Distance to nearest 4-year college / technical college.
- Unemployment rate; median home value (modern).
- If school-level: school grade span, total enrollment, share free/reduced lunch.

## Design choices to address pre-existing trends / differences across sides

1. Propensity-weighted comparison boundaries (construct matched pseudo-borders where pre-treatment trends are similar; then triple-diff).
2. Narrow bandwidth: restrict to units within X meters (e.g., 0.25 mile / 0.5 mile) of the HOLC border. Show sensitivity to bandwidth.
3. Covariate balancing: check whether pre-1930 (or earliest available) covariates differ ‚Äî if so, use weighting or include historical controls.
4. Placebo tests: run the same RD on outcomes you expect no long-run effect on (e.g., adult rates of unrelated majors like classics), or run fake borders.

## Methods and Data Pitch
Aaronson et al. (2021, 2022) provide some of the most rigorous causal evidence on the long-run effects of redlining by using a boundary discontinuity design: they compared neighborhoods just inside versus just outside HOLC map boundaries. This approach is powerful because it isolates the effect of HOLC grades from pre-existing differences across cities or neighborhoods, making the estimated impact of redlining more credible. Mimicking this methodology for a study of STEM outcomes would not only extend an influential framework into a new domain‚Äîeducation and workforce pipelines‚Äîbut also position your research as a direct contribution to a well-established literature in economics. By following Aaronson‚Äôs identification strategy, I can credibly test whether redlining has had enduring effects on STEM opportunities, connecting neighborhood disinvestment to one of the most pressing areas of workforce inequity today.

The datasets available today make this extension feasible and rigorous:

- Mapping Inequality (HOLC Maps): Provides digitized historical redlining boundaries from the 1930s, Allows you to identify which modern schools or neighborhoods overlap with HOLC grades, Essential for constructing treatment variables (e.g., ‚ÄúC‚Äù/‚ÄúD‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúA‚Äù/‚ÄúB‚Äù areas) and implementing a boundary discontinuity design.

- Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC): School-level national data on whether advanced STEM courses (calculus, physics, computer science, AP STEM) are offered, Direct measure of STEM opportunity at the K‚Äì12 level, which is critical to evaluating how redlining may have influenced access to rigorous coursework.

- NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) ‚Äì School Finance: District-level spending and revenue data, Captures the funding mechanism (property-tax reliance) that links redlining to unequal school resources, and can serve as a mediating variable in your models.

- American Community Survey (ACS) / IPUMS: Provides tract- or PUMA-level data on educational attainment and field-of-degree (including STEM majors), Allows you to test whether historically redlined neighborhoods today produce fewer STEM degree holders, linking early schooling disadvantages to long-run outcomes.

- Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) (optional extension): Degree completions by field and race at the institutional level, Useful for connecting neighborhood-of-origin measures (via ZIP code) to higher education STEM outcomes, adding another layer of analysis.
