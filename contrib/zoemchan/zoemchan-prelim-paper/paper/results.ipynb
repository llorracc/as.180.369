    "Figure 1 displays the geographic overlay of Chicago’s public schools and historical HOLC grades. The visual highlights a stark spatial pattern: schools located in neighborhoods graded “C” (“Definitely Declining”) or “D” (“Hazardous”) are heavily concentrated in the South and West Sides—areas long associated with disinvestment, lower home values, and predominantly Black or Hispanic populations. In contrast, “A” (“Best”) and “B” (“Still Desirable”) neighborhoods, concentrated in the North and Northwest, host schools with more abundant academic and material resources. This pattern visually previews the central finding that historical redlining continues to shape present-day educational opportunity."

The coefficient on `Low_HOLC_CD` is negative and statistically meaningful, indicating that schools located in historically redlined neighborhoods have substantially *lower odds* of offering calculus, physics, or computer science. Interpreting the coefficient in marginal terms, schools in “C” or “D” neighborhoods are roughly **20–30% less likely** to offer any advanced STEM class than those in “A” or “B” neighborhoods, holding enrollment, grade span, and local socioeconomic controls constant.\n"

Even after accounting for observable differences, the probability that a school in a historically “C/D” neighborhood offers at least one advanced STEM course remains significantly lower. This visualization provides strong descriptive evidence that the historical boundaries drawn in the 1930s are mirrored in the geography of STEM opportunity nearly a century later."

The negative coefficient on `Low_HOLC_CD` implies that schools in historically disinvested neighborhoods offer fewer total STEM courses—about **0.3 to 0.5 fewer courses** on average than comparable schools in non-redlined zones. While this difference may appear modest, it is meaningful when viewed through an opportunity lens: it suggests that students in redlined areas not only face lower odds of any STEM exposure, but also have a narrower range of STEM pathways once enrolled.\n",

    "Extending the analysis nationwide, Table 2 presents regression results pooling schools across all cities with digitized HOLC maps. As in the Chicago analysis, the logistic regression shows that schools in neighborhoods graded “B,” “C,” or “D” have systematically lower odds of offering any advanced STEM course compared to those in “A” neighborhoods. The odds ratios for Grades “C” and “D” hover around **0.78–0.81**, implying a roughly **20% reduction in the likelihood** of offering advanced STEM coursework.

    "The negative binomial regression results (Table X) quantify how the number of STEM courses offered varies by historical HOLC grade. Schools located in neighborhoods that were rated lower by the HOLC exhibit a pronounced reduction in STEM course availability relative to those in “A” (Best) areas. Specifically, schools in “B” areas offer approximately **41% fewer STEM courses** (IRR = 0.59), “C” areas offer **about half as many** (IRR = 0.50), and “D” (“Hazardous”) areas offer **roughly 60% fewer** (IRR = 0.40) than comparable schools in historically advantaged zones.

    "The results from both Chicago and the national sample provide converging evidence that the historical geography of redlining continues to shape the educational infrastructure of opportunity. The patterns are remarkably consistent across scales: where the HOLC once labeled neighborhoods as “declining” or “hazardous,” schools today are significantly less likely to provide students access to rigorous STEM preparation. These findings suggest that historical housing discrimination not only influenced wealth accumulation and neighborhood stability but also the local public investment in schools necessary for cultivating future technical talent.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a policy perspective, these results illuminate a structural mechanism underlying racial and spatial disparities in STEM participation. Because STEM course availability is a strong predictor of college major selection and later STEM employment, unequal access at the K–12 level perpetuates downstream inequities in higher education and the workforce. The persistence of these gaps—visible decades after the formal end of redlining—underscores how durable institutional boundaries can translate into intergenerational opportunity divides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the magnitude of these effects, though moderate in statistical terms, is socially significant. A 20–30% reduction in the likelihood of advanced STEM offerings translates into thousands of students per district lacking access to calculus or computer science each year. The results therefore reinforce the view that redlining’s legacy should not be treated solely as an artifact of housing policy, but as a foundational determinant of educational and occupational inequality in the modern STEM economy."
