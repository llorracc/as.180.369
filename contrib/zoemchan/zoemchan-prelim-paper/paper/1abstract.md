# Abstract

This paper examines whether the legacy of historical redlining continues to shape access to advanced STEM coursework in American public schools. Using digitized Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) maps linked with contemporary school-level data, the study tests whether schools located in formerly lower-rated neighborhoods (Grades “C” and “D”) are less likely to offer advanced STEM courses such as calculus, physics, chemistry, and computer science. The analysis employs a boundary discontinuity design that compares schools located within 0.25 miles of HOLC boundaries, isolating local effects while holding constant broader neighborhood and city-level characteristics. A national analysis across 113 metropolitan areas with at least three distinct HOLC grades provides a comprehensive assessment of redlining’s enduring impact, followed by localized analyses of Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Detroit to capture regional variation. Preliminary findings indicate that schools in historically redlined zones exhibit systematically lower access to advanced STEM courses, even after controlling for modern socioeconomic differences. These results suggest that the geography of historical housing discrimination continues to shape contemporary educational opportunity, reinforcing intergenerational inequality in access to high-opportunity fields.
