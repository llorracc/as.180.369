This paper investigates the relationship between historical redlining and modern disparities in access to STEM education across U.S. school districts. Redlining—once used to restrict investment in minority neighborhoods—has left lasting imprints on the distribution of educational resources. Using geospatial data linking Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) redlining maps to present-day school district boundaries, this study examines whether historically redlined neighborhoods are less likely to host schools offering advanced STEM courses such as calculus, physics, and computer science. Following the empirical approach of Aaronson et al. (2021, 2022), the analysis compares schools and neighborhoods located just across historical redlining boundaries to isolate the local effects of redline grading from broader regional trends. By combining this border-based design with controls for current socioeconomic and demographic factors, the study aims to identify the causal impact of redlining on present-day STEM access. Results suggest that schools located in areas formerly rated “hazardous” or “declining” continue to exhibit significantly reduced access to advanced STEM opportunities. These findings highlight the persistent structural consequences of redlining on educational equity and underscore the need for targeted policy interventions to expand STEM access in historically marginalized communities.
