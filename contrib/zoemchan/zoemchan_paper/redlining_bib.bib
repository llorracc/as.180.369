               grades assigned >80y ago through security maps from the Home
               Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) are associated with current
               sociodemographics and adverse health outcomes. We assessed
               whether historical HOLC investment grades are associated with
               2010 greenspace, a health-promoting neighborhood resource.
               OBJECTIVES: We compared 2010 normalized difference vegetation
               index (NDVI) across previous HOLC neighborhood grades using
               propensity score restriction and matching. METHODS: Security map
               shapefiles were downloaded from the Mapping Inequality Project.
               Neighborhood investment risk grades included A (best, green), B
               (blue), C (yellow), and D (hazardous, red, i.e., redlined). We
               used 2010 satellite imagery to calculate the average NDVI for
               each HOLC neighborhood. Our main outcomes were 2010 annual
               average NDVI and summer NDVI. We assigned areal-apportioned 1940
               census measures to each HOLC neighborhood. We used propensity
               score restriction, matching, and targeted maximum likelihood
               estimation to limit model extrapolation, reduce confounding, and
               estimate the association between HOLC grade and NDVI for the
               following comparisons: Grades B vs. A, C vs. B, and D vs. C.
               RESULTS: Across 102 urban areas (4,141 HOLC polygons), annual
               average ±standard deviation (SD) 2010 NDVI was 0.47 (±0.09), 0.43
               (±0.09), 0.39 (±0.09), and 0.36 (±0.10) in Grades A-D,
               respectively. In analyses adjusted for current ecoregion and
               census region, 1940s census measures, and 1940s population
               density, annual average NDVI values in 2010 were estimated at
               -0.039 (95\% CI: -0.045, -0.034), -0.024 (95\% CI: -0.030,
               -0.018), and -0.026 (95\% CI: -0.037, -0.015) for Grades B vs. A,
               C vs. B, and D vs. C, respectively, in the 1930s. DISCUSSION:
               Estimates adjusted for historical characteristics indicate that
               neighborhoods assigned worse HOLC grades in the 1930s are
               associated with reduced present-day greenspace.

               public school spending affects student outcomes. The school
               finance reforms that began in the early 1970s and accelerated in
               the 1980s caused dramatic changes to the structure of K–12
               education spending in the United States. To study the effect of
               these school finance reform–induced changes in public school
               spending on long-run adult outcomes, we link school spending and
               school finance reform data to detailed, nationally representative
               data on children born between 1955 and 1985 and followed through
               2011. We use the timing of the passage of court-mandated reforms
               and their associated type of funding formula change as exogenous
               shifters of school spending, and we compare the adult outcomes of

               reforms, depending on place and year of birth. Event study and
               instrumental variable models reveal that a 10\% increase in per

               observe that vulnerable communities—especially those within urban
               areas in the United States—are disproportionately exposed to

               intra-urban heat. Here, we explore the relationship between
               “redlining”, or the historical practice of refusing home loans or
               insurance to whole neighborhoods based on a racially motivated
               perception of safety for investment, with present-day summertime
               intra-urban land surface temperature anomalies. Through a spatial
               analysis of 108 urban areas in the United States, we ask two
               questions: (1) how do historically redlined neighborhoods relate
               to current patterns of intra-urban heat? and (2) do these
               patterns vary by US Census Bureau region? Our results reveal that
               94\% of studied areas display consistent city-scale patterns of
               elevated land surface temperatures in formerly redlined areas
               relative to their non-redlined neighbors by as much as 7 °C.
               Regionally, Southeast and Western cities display the greatest
               differences while Midwest cities display the least. Nationally,
               land surface temperatures in redlined areas are approximately 2.6
               °C warmer than in non-redlined areas. While these trends are
               partly attributable to the relative preponderance of impervious
               land cover to tree canopy in these areas, which we also examine,
               other factors may also be driving these differences. This study
               reveals that historical housing policies may, in fact, be
               directly responsible for disproportionate exposure to current

               that restricted access to credit in urban communities. For
               empirical identification, we use a regression discontinuity
               design that exploits boundaries from maps created by the Home
               Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) in 1940. We find that ``redlined''
               neighborhoods have 4.8\% lower home prices in 1990 relative to
               adjacent areas. This finding is robust to the exclusion of
               boundaries that coincide with the physical features of cities
               (e.g., rivers, landmarks). Moreover, we show that housing
               characteristics varied smoothly at the boundaries when the maps
               were created. Evidence suggests lower property values may be
               driven by negative externalities associated with fewer
               owner-occupied homes and more vacant structures. Overall, our
               results indicate the effects of discriminatory credit rationing
               can persist decades after such practices are formally
               discontinued.",
