    "Across the national sample of 1,767 high schools located within 0.25 miles of a historical HOLC boundary, access to advanced STEM coursework declines consistently across the HOLC grading scale. Figure 1 presents predicted probabilities from the logistic regression model. Schools in formerly “A” neighborhoods exhibit the highest likelihood of offering at least one advanced STEM course (approximately 0.80), while those in “D” neighborhoods show probabilities closer to 0.74. Although the overall decline appears modest, it is monotonic and precisely aligned with expectations surrounding redlining’s long-term effects."

    "A complementary perspective comes from examining the average number of courses offered in each subject area. Figure 3 plots the mean number of calculus, computer science, and physics courses by HOLC grade. The pattern again shows a smooth, monotonic decline from A → D for every subject. On average, A-rated neighborhoods offer the highest levels of advanced math and science—approximately 3.4 calculus classes, 5.6 computer science classes, and more than 8 physics classes. These averages fall sharply for lower-rated neighborhoods: D-rated areas typically offer only about 1 calculus class, 2.2 computer science classes, and 4.3 physics classes.

As in the national design, I restrict the analysis to high schools located within 0.25 miles of a historical redlining boundary to ensure that comparisons are made across locally similar areas. The goal of this section is not to compare cities to one another, but rather to evaluate whether the patterns observed nationally also hold within individual urban contexts, and to understand where and why deviations may occur."

Philadelphia exhibits a similar but less pronounced gradient, in part because fewer schools are located in A-rated neighborhoods within the 0.25-mile boundary sample.

The first column reports the effect of redlining on the probability that a school offers at least one advanced STEM course (Any STEM). The second column reports the effect on the total number of advanced STEM courses offered. Negative coefficients indicate reduced STEM access in C/D zones. Chicago and Detroit display large negative effects consistent with national patterns, Philadelphia shows smaller and imprecise effects, and Los Angeles exhibits positive coefficients, reflecting the city’s unique distribution of magnet and specialized schools in lower-rated historical zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across cities, Chicago and Detroit show strong negative associations between redlining and STEM access. In Chicago, schools in C/D neighborhoods are 17.4 percentage points less likely to offer any advanced STEM course, and they offer 6.05 fewer courses in total. Detroit displays even larger effects: a 28.3–percentage point reduction in the probability of offering any advanced STEM and a striking 24.5-course deficit in total offerings. These magnitudes exceed the national estimates and suggest that historical neighborhood ratings continue to strongly shape educational opportunity in cities where economic and demographic segregation remain especially pronounced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Philadelphia’s binary redline effects are small and statistically inconsistent in magnitude (−2.29 to +8.39), echoing the ambiguity in the descriptive plots. This is likely explained by the limited number of schools in A-rated neighborhoods within the boundary sample—many HOLC A areas in Philadelphia were historically smaller and more residential, resulting in fewer present-day high schools. As a result, estimates for A→D comparisons are noisier and less stable than in Chicago or Detroit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Los Angeles is the only city where both coefficients point in the opposite direction of national patterns. Schools in historically redlined areas are estimated to be slightly more likely to offer any advanced STEM course (+7.9 percentage points) and to offer more STEM courses overall (+2.42). Importantly, this does not necessarily imply that redlining “reversed” in Los Angeles. Rather, it reflects two structural features of the city: (1) extensive postwar suburban expansion that altered the distribution of school types relative to HOLC boundaries, and (2) a concentration of magnet and specialized high schools in historically lower-rated central LA neighborhoods. These institutional dynamics mean that HOLC boundaries in Los Angeles align less cleanly with present-day school resources than in the more rigidly segregated Midwestern and Northeastern cities.\n",

    "The categorical regression results (Table V) reinforce these patterns. Chicago and Detroit again show monotonic declines across B, C, and D categories for both AnySTEM and TotalSTEM outcomes, mirroring the national gradient.

    "**Table V. City-Level Categorical HOLC Grade Effects on STEM Access**\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes: This table reports regression estimates comparing each HOLC grade (B, C, and D) to A-rated neighborhoods within each city. Columns 1–3 present the effects on the probability that a school offers at least one advanced STEM course (Any STEM). Columns 4–6 present the effects on the total number of advanced STEM courses offered. Chicago and Detroit show clear monotonic declines from B → C → D, aligning with national patterns of reduced STEM opportunity in lower-rated historical zones. Philadelphia exhibits modest and variable effects, largely due to limited A-rated coverage in the boundary sample. Los Angeles again departs from the national trend, displaying positive coefficients across categories, likely reflecting its concentrated magnet and specialized high school presence in historically lower-rated neighborhoods."

    "### Comparison to National Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, the city-level analyses demonstrate that the national results are not driven solely by one or two metropolitan areas. Chicago and Detroit closely replicate the national pattern: schools in historically redlined areas offer significantly fewer STEM classes and are less likely to offer any at all. Philadelphia shows muted effects due to small sample sizes in top-rated areas, but its qualitative direction aligns with the national trend. Los Angeles, by contrast, deviates from both the national pattern and the other cities—largely due to the city’s distinct educational geography, including widespread magnet programs located disproportionately in lower-rated HOLC areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these results suggest that redlining’s educational legacy is robust at a broad scale, yet its local manifestation varies depending on how historical boundaries intersect with postwar development, school-choice ecosystems, and district-level reforms. In cities with stable neighborhood structures (Chicago, Detroit), the HOLC gradient remains a powerful predictor of STEM access. In cities with significant postwar transformation (Los Angeles) or limited A-rated coverage (Philadelphia), the relationship becomes more diffuse. Nonetheless, even in these cases, descriptive patterns still show disparities in STEM depth across neighborhoods, consistent with broader structural inequalities."
