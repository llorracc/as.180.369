# Conclusion

This paper examines the long-run relationship between historical redlining and contemporary access to advanced STEM coursework in U.S. public high schools. Using a boundary discontinuity design across 113 cities and detailed case studies of Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Detroit, the analysis provides consistent evidence that the educational landscape inherited from the 1930s HOLC maps continues to shape students’ opportunities to pursue rigorous STEM preparation today.

Across the national sample, STEM access declines steadily from HOLC A → D neighborhoods. Schools in historically lower-rated areas are not only less likely to offer any advanced STEM coursework, but also offer substantially fewer courses across calculus, physics, and computer science. These patterns persist within narrow geographic buffers surrounding historical boundaries, highlighting the lasting influence of neighborhood-level disadvantage independent of broader citywide conditions.

The city-level analyses reinforce, refine, and contextualize these national trends. In Chicago and Detroit, the effects of redlining are especially pronounced, with large deficits in both the probability of offering any STEM course and the total number of courses offered. Philadelphia shows a similar directional pattern with somewhat less precision, reflecting its smaller number of A-rated schools in the boundary sample. Los Angeles stands apart from the expected gradient, likely due to its unique distribution of magnet and specialized high schools, illustrating that contemporary educational policies and urban development can either reinforce or weaken historical spatial patterns. Together, these cases demonstrate that while the national relationship between redlining and STEM access is strong, its local manifestations depend on how school systems and cities have evolved in the decades since the HOLC maps were created.

Although this study does not attempt to quantify the full causal effect of redlining or evaluate specific policy interventions, the findings suggest meaningful avenues for expanding educational opportunity. Targeted investments in advanced STEM programs, revisiting the placement of magnet and specialty schools, and strengthening teacher pipelines in historically disadvantaged areas may help mitigate some of the persistent disparities identified here. More broadly, the results emphasize the need to consider how historical structures continue to shape educational environments and how modern policy can either counteract or reproduce those legacies.

Redlining may be nearly a century old, but its educational imprint remains visible. Understanding how these long-standing patterns continue to affect students’ access to advanced STEM preparation is essential for designing policies that expand opportunity and promote equity across American schools.
