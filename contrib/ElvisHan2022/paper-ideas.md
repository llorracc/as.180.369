# Research Proposal: Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) and Value-Based Care

This project examines the **Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP)**, one of the first nationwide value-based care initiatives in the United States. HRRP penalizes hospitals with higher-than-expected 30-day readmissions for targeted conditions such as heart failure, pneumonia, and acute myocardial infarction, later expanded to COPD, elective hip and knee replacements, and CABG surgery. The program has been widely studied, with prior research showing both intended and unintended effects. For example, Wadhera and Dharmarajan found possible increases in mortality for heart failure and pneumonia patients, Sabbatini demonstrated that readmission reductions shrink when observation stays are included, and MedPAC reports concluded that safety-net hospitals were disproportionately penalized. These findings highlight the tension between efficiency gains and potential trade-offs in equity and patient safety.

To build on this literature, the project uses hospital-level panel data from 2008â€“2020 in a **difference-in-differences design**, comparing targeted vs. non-targeted conditions before and after HRRP implementation. Unlike many earlier studies that stop in the mid-2010s, this longer time horizon allows for testing whether effects persisted, strengthened, or faded. In addition, I will employ **event study estimators**, which trace outcomes year by year around the policy change. This method provides a stronger check for parallel pre-trends and shows whether effects emerged immediately or evolved over time.

The central hypothesis is that HRRP reduced readmissions for targeted conditions but also led hospitals to substitute patients into observation stays and emergency department revisits, with mixed effects on mortality and larger penalties for safety-net hospitals. By extending the timeline, jointly analyzing readmissions, observation stays, ED revisits, and mortality, and incorporating dynamic event study analysis, this project contributes new evidence on how policy-driven incentives reshape hospital decision-making under value-based care.

## Key Hypotheses
1. **Intended Effect:** HRRP reduced 30-day readmissions for targeted conditions relative to non-targeted conditions.  
2. **Behavioral Response:** Hospitals increased the use of observation stays and emergency department revisits for targeted conditions to avoid penalties.  
3. **Patient Outcomes:** Mortality effects are mixed, with potential increases for heart failure and pneumonia patients.  
4. **Equity:** Safety-net hospitals faced disproportionate penalties and smaller improvements, widening disparities.  
5. **Spillovers:** Hospital-wide readmission management produced spillover reductions for some non-targeted conditions.  
6. **Dynamics:** Policy effects intensified during early penalty years and evolved after later refinements (e.g., 2019 risk stratification).
