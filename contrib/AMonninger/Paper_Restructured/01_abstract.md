This study examines the sensitivity of Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) firms' stock returns to changes in monetary policy, specifically the Federal Funds Rate.

Using a multi-factor regression framework with robust standard errors, the analysis estimates the relationship between BNPL stock returns and interest rate changes while controlling for market movements, consumer spending patterns, credit market conditions, and macroeconomic factors.The analysis spans the period from 2020 to 2025, capturing the rapid growth of the BNPL industry alongside significant monetary policy shifts.The results indicate that BNPL firms exhibit sensitivity to interest rate changes through multiple channels: funding costs, consumer demand, and credit market conditions.

This research contributes to the emerging literature on fintech firm valuation and provides insights into the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy to alternative credit providers.
