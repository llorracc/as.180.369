## 1.2 Research Contribution

This study contributes to three distinct strands of literature, each addressing important gaps in understanding of fintech firm behavior and monetary policy transmission.

The contribution to each literature strand is substantial, as BNPL represents a rapidly growing but understudied segment of the financial services industry.

First, in the fintech valuation literature, the study examines how alternative financial service providers respond to macroeconomic shocks.

While extensive research exists on traditional bank sensitivity to interest rates, relatively little work has examined how newer fintech lending models, particularly BNPL firms, respond to monetary policy changes.

Bian, Cong, and Ji examine BNPL's role in payment competition and credit expansion, documenting that BNPL significantly boosts consumption and complements credit cards for small-value transactions, but do not directly address stock return sensitivity to interest rates (Bian et al. 15-18).

This study fills this gap by providing empirical evidence on BNPL firms' sensitivity to monetary policy, contributing to the broader understanding of how fintech firms differ from traditional financial institutions in their response to macroeconomic conditions.

Second, the study contributes to the monetary policy transmission literature by exploring how unconventional credit providers transmit monetary policy to consumers.

Traditional monetary policy transmission mechanisms focus on banks' lending channels, where policy rate changes affect bank funding costs, which in turn affect lending rates and credit availability.

However, BNPL firms represent an alternative credit provision mechanism that may amplify or dampen policy effects through different channels.

Laudenbach et al. document that BNPL firms offer 1.4 percentage point interest rate discounts to consumers, indicating thin profit margins that amplify sensitivity to funding cost changes (Laudenbach et al. 12-15).

This study examines how these thin margins translate into stock return sensitivity, providing insights into monetary policy transmission through alternative credit channels and contributing to the understanding of how monetary policy affects different segments of the credit market.

Third, the study contributes to consumer credit markets research by analyzing the relationship between monetary policy and consumer credit availability through BNPL firms.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Consumer Use Report documents that BNPL borrowers have subprime credit scores (580-669) compared to non-users (670-739), higher credit card utilization rates (60-66% versus 34%), and are more likely to revolve on credit cards (69% versus 42%) (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, "Consumer Use" 12-15).

Understanding how monetary policy affects BNPL firms' ability to extend credit to these consumers has important implications for financial inclusion and consumer welfare, particularly given that BNPL serves consumers who may have limited access to traditional credit products.
