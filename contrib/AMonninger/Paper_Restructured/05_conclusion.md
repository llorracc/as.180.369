## 7. Summary and Conclusions

## 7.1 Research Question and Methodology

This study addresses a fundamental question in financial economics: How do Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) firms' stock returns respond to changes in the Federal Funds Rate, after controlling for market movements, consumer spending patterns, credit market conditions, and other macroeconomic factors?

This question is motivated by the unique funding structure of BNPL firms, which rely heavily on warehouse credit facilities, securitization, and sale-and-repurchase agreements that create immediate pass-through of interest rate changes to funding costs.

The analysis employs a multi-factor linear regression framework, examining monthly BNPL stock returns as a function of Federal Funds Rate changes and a comprehensive set of control variables that capture market movements, consumer behavior, credit conditions, and macroeconomic factors.

This methodological approach allows us to isolate the effect of interest rate changes on BNPL returns while controlling for other factors that might confound the relationship.

The empirical analysis spans the period from May 2020 to August 2025, comprising 27 monthly observations that capture both the rapid growth phase of the BNPL industry and significant monetary policy shifts, including the Federal Reserve's transition from near-zero interest rates to approximately 5% over the sample period.

This substantial variation in monetary policy provides strong identification for estimating interest rate sensitivity, as the dramatic shift from accommodative to restrictive monetary policy creates a natural experiment for examining how BNPL firms respond to rate changes.

The sample period coincides with major BNPL firms' initial public offerings (Affirm Holdings in 2021, Sezzle in 2020), making this analysis among the first to examine BNPL stock returns over a meaningful time horizon with substantial monetary policy variation.

### 7.2 Key Empirical Findings

The primary finding of this analysis is that the coefficient on Federal Funds Rate changes (β₁ = 11.4156) is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.7999), indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that BNPL stock returns are insensitive to interest rate changes.

This null result does not imply that no relationship exists, but rather that our sample size and data quality do not provide sufficient statistical power to detect a relationship if one exists. The confidence interval includes zero, spanning a wide range from negative to positive values, reflecting the substantial uncertainty in our estimate due to limited sample size and high volatility in BNPL stock returns. The model achieves an R-squared of 0.3243, meaning that our six core variables (Federal Funds Rate change, retail sales growth, consumer confidence change, credit spread change, consumer credit growth, and inflation rate) collectively explain approximately 32.4% of the variance in BNPL stock returns.

This level of explanatory power is reasonable for financial returns models, as stock returns are inherently noisy and driven by many unobserved factors including firm-specific news, regulatory changes, competitive dynamics, and investor sentiment.

Even sophisticated asset pricing models typically achieve R-squared values between 0.10 and 0.40 for stock returns, making our R-squared of 0.32 consistent with expectations for this type of analysis.

Secondary findings reveal that consumer spending variables (retail sales growth) and credit market variables (consumer credit growth) show expected signs but are not statistically significant at conventional levels.

Consumer confidence changes and inflation rates also fail to achieve statistical significance, though their coefficients align with theoretical predictions. The lack of statistical significance for these variables may reflect the limited sample size, high volatility in BNPL returns, or the dominance of other factors not captured in our model specification.

## 7.3 Model Fit and Robustness

The multi-factor model demonstrates improved fit compared to a simple univariate regression, with R-squared increasing substantially when market controls and other macroeconomic factors are included.

This improvement validates our multi-factor approach, as controlling for market movements, consumer behavior, and credit conditions provides a cleaner estimate of BNPL-specific interest rate sensitivity. The comparison between simple and multi-factor models demonstrates the robustness of our results, showing that the null finding on interest rate sensitivity persists across different model specifications.

However, the model's explanatory power remains moderate, with approximately 68% of the variance in BNPL returns unexplained by our variables.

This unexplained variance reflects the inherent difficulty of predicting stock returns, which are driven by many factors including firm-specific news, regulatory changes, competitive dynamics, and investor sentiment that are not captured in our macroeconomic model. The substantial unexplained variance is consistent with the efficient markets hypothesis, which suggests that stock prices incorporate all available information and that excess returns are difficult to predict using publicly available data.

## 7.4 Limitations and Scope

This study faces several important limitations that warrant consideration when interpreting results.

First, the sample size is limited to 27 monthly observations, reflecting the relatively recent emergence of the BNPL industry as a publicly traded sector.

Major BNPL firms such as Affirm Holdings and Sezzle only went public in 2020-2021, limiting available historical data.

This limited sample size reduces statistical power and may prevent detection of relationships that exist but are not statistically significant at conventional levels.

However, we employ robust standard errors and conservative inference procedures to address these concerns, and the substantial variation in interest rates over our sample period (from near-zero to approximately 5%) provides strong identification despite the limited sample size.

Second, the time period may not capture full business cycles or long-term relationships, as economic effects can be lagged and may take quarters or years to fully manifest. The analysis spans a period of dramatic monetary policy shifts, providing substantial variation for identification, but may not capture relationships that operate over longer horizons.

However, the focus on short-term relationships is appropriate for stock return analysis, as stock prices are forward-looking and should incorporate expectations about future profitability relatively quickly.

Third, other factors that affect BNPL returns may not be fully controlled, including firm-specific news (earnings announcements, product launches, management changes), regulatory changes (such as the CFPB's May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit cards), competitive dynamics, and investor sentiment.

These unobserved factors may dominate the signal from interest rate changes, making it difficult to detect the relationship even if it exists. The high volatility in BNPL returns, combined with the relatively small sample size, creates substantial noise that may mask the underlying relationship.

Fourth, potential endogeneity concerns arise from the possibility that interest rates may respond to economic conditions that also affect BNPL firms. For example, the Federal Reserve may raise rates in response to inflation or economic overheating, which may simultaneously affect consumer spending and BNPL demand.

However, the focus on Federal Funds Rate changes rather than levels, combined with the use of monthly data, helps mitigate these concerns by focusing on short-term monetary policy shocks rather than long-term economic conditions.

## 7.5 Policy Implications

Despite the null finding on statistical significance, the analysis provides important insights for monetary policy, financial regulation, and investment decision-making. The theoretical framework and empirical literature strongly suggest that BNPL firms should be sensitive to interest rate changes due to their funding structure and thin profit margins.

Laudenbach et al. document that BNPL firms offer 1.4 percentage point interest rate discounts to consumers, indicating thin profit margins that amplify sensitivity to funding cost changes (Laudenbach et al.).

Affirm Holdings' 2024 Annual Report explicitly identifies "elevated interest rate environment" as a key risk factor, confirming that BNPL firms themselves recognize their vulnerability to rate changes. For monetary policymakers, this analysis suggests that BNPL firms may be disproportionately affected by interest rate increases, even if statistical significance is not achieved in this sample. The funding structure of BNPL firms creates immediate pass-through of rate increases to funding costs, potentially affecting their profitability and lending capacity.

However, the lack of statistical significance suggests that other factors may dominate BNPL returns in the short term, making it difficult to isolate the interest rate effect. For financial regulators, the analysis highlights the importance of monitoring BNPL firms' funding structures and interest rate risk exposure. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit cards may affect BNPL firms' regulatory environment and funding costs, potentially amplifying their sensitivity to interest rate changes.

Regulators should consider how monetary policy changes affect BNPL firms' profitability and lending capacity, particularly given their role in providing credit to subprime consumers who may be particularly vulnerable to economic downturns. For investors, the analysis suggests that BNPL stocks may exhibit sensitivity to interest rate changes, though this sensitivity may be difficult to detect in short-term data due to high volatility and other factors.

Investors should consider interest rate sensitivity when evaluating BNPL stocks, particularly during periods of monetary policy tightening.

However, the lack of statistical significance suggests that other factors, including firm-specific news, regulatory changes, and competitive dynamics, may dominate returns in the short term.

## 7.6 Future Research Directions

Several directions for future research emerge from this analysis.

First, as more data becomes available with the passage of time, future studies will be able to examine BNPL interest rate sensitivity with larger sample sizes and greater statistical power. The BNPL industry is still relatively new, and as firms accumulate more quarterly earnings reports and experience more monetary policy cycles, researchers will be able to provide more definitive evidence on interest rate sensitivity.

Second, future research could examine alternative model specifications, including non-linear relationships, lagged effects, and interaction terms that capture how BNPL sensitivity varies across different economic conditions. The relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns may be non-linear, with sensitivity increasing at higher rate levels, or may operate with lags as firms adjust their funding structures and pricing in response to rate changes.

Third, future research could incorporate firm-level data, examining how individual BNPL firms' funding structures, profit margins, and business models affect their sensitivity to interest rate changes.

Panel data analysis with firm fixed effects could provide more precise estimates by controlling for unobserved firm characteristics and exploiting within-firm variation over time.

Fourth, future research could examine how regulatory changes, such as the CFPB's May 2024 ruling classifying BNPL as credit cards, affect BNPL firms' interest rate sensitivity.

This regulatory change may alter BNPL firms' funding structures, regulatory compliance costs, and competitive positioning, potentially affecting their sensitivity to monetary policy changes.

Ultimately, this analysis provides a foundation for understanding BNPL firms' sensitivity to monetary policy, while highlighting the challenges of detecting relationships in financial returns data with limited sample sizes. As the BNPL industry matures and more data becomes available, future research will be able to provide more definitive evidence on the relationship between interest rates and BNPL stock returns, contributing to our understanding of how monetary policy affects fintech firms and the broader financial system.
