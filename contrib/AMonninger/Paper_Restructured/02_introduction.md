## 1. Introduction and Research Question

## 1.1 Research Question

The emergence of Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) as a significant alternative credit provision mechanism raises fundamental questions about how these firms respond to macroeconomic shocks, particularly monetary policy changes.

Unlike traditional financial institutions that benefit from deposit bases and diversified revenue streams, BNPL firms operate under a fundamentally distinct business model characterized by wholesale funding dependence and razor-thin profit margins.

This structural difference suggests that BNPL firms may exhibit differential sensitivity to interest rate changes compared to traditional financial stocks, yet empirical evidence on this relationship remains limited.

The primary research question driving this investigation is: How do BNPL firms' stock returns respond to changes in the Federal Funds Rate, after controlling for market-wide movements and macroeconomic factors?

This question emerges from the theoretical observation that BNPL firms' funding structure creates immediate pass-through of monetary policy changes to their cost of capital, while their thin operating margins amplify the impact of funding cost increases on profitability.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Market Trends Report provides empirical context for this question, documenting that BNPL Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) grew from USD 2 billion in 2019 to USD 24.2 billion in 2021, representing a 1,092% compound annual growth rate, yet unit margins declined from 1.27% in 2020 to 1.01% in 2021, suggesting vulnerability to cost increases (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, "Buy Now, Pay Later" 5-7, 18-22).

## 1.1.1 U.S. BNPL Market Context and Growth Statistics

The U.S. BNPL market has experienced rapid expansion, with adoption accelerating significantly in recent years.

According to recent market analysis, North America (primarily the United States) accounted for approximately 29-32% of global BNPL provider revenue in 2024, consistently ranking among the top regions by provider earnings (Emewulu).

U.S. BNPL user adoption has grown substantially, expanding from 86.5 million users in 2024 to a projected 91.5 million users in 2025, reflecting annual growth of approximately 6-7% (Emewulu).

Consumer adoption patterns reveal important insights into BNPL usage in the United States.

Empirical estimates indicate that 21% of U.S. consumers with a credit record financed at least one purchase using BNPL from one of the six major providers (Affirm, Afterpay, Klarna, PayPal, Sezzle, and Zip) in 2022, with the average purchase amount being USD 142 and the median purchase amount being USD 108 (Emewulu).

The average annual BNPL originations per borrower increased from 8.5 loans in 2021 to 9.5 loans in 2022, demonstrating intensifying usage patterns among existing users (Emewulu).

However, this rapid growth has been accompanied by concerning patterns of consumer financial stress and overextension.

Approximately 34-41% of BNPL users reported making late payments in the past year, with Gen Z users showing a higher delinquency rate of 51%, raising significant concerns about consumer debt and repayment capacity (Emewulu).

Loan stacking (the practice of holding multiple BNPL loans simultaneously) has become prevalent, with 63% of BNPL borrowers originating multiple simultaneous loans in 2022, and 33% holding loans across multiple BNPL providers, creating hidden debt exposure that may not be visible to traditional credit reporting systems (Emewulu).

This pattern of multiple concurrent loans across providers suggests that consumers may be using BNPL to manage cash flow constraints, potentially amplifying financial vulnerability.

The demographic and credit profile of U.S. BNPL users further highlights the sector's sensitivity to economic conditions.

Approximately 61% of U.S. BNPL borrowers fall into subprime or deep subprime credit categories, with these users exhibiting average credit card utilization rates of 60-66%, compared to 34% for non-BNPL users (Emewulu).

This high utilization rate, combined with the prevalence of loan stacking, suggests that BNPL users may be particularly vulnerable to interest rate increases and economic shocks, as they have limited financial buffers and higher existing debt burdens.

These patterns support the theoretical prediction that BNPL firms' stock returns should exhibit sensitivity to monetary policy changes, as their customer base consists disproportionately of financially constrained consumers who are likely to reduce spending and increase defaults when interest rates rise.

PayPal's BNPL service demonstrates particularly high adoption in the U.S. market, with 68% of surveyed U.S. online shoppers reporting having used PayPal's BNPL service at least once in 2025, placing it among the most widely adopted BNPL brands in the country (Emewulu).

This high adoption rate reflects PayPal's established position in the digital payments ecosystem and its integration with existing merchant networks, though it also suggests that PayPal's BNPL operations may be particularly sensitive to changes in consumer spending patterns and credit conditions.

Regulatory developments in the United States are also shaping the BNPL landscape.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed new rules for 2025 that would mandate credit bureau reporting for BNPL loans, require clearer disclosures, and enhance consumer protections to surface hidden debt and strengthen oversight (Emewulu).

These regulatory changes may affect BNPL firms' business models and profitability, potentially reducing adoption among subprime borrowers who represent a significant share of current users, while also improving transparency and reducing hidden debt accumulation.

Several secondary questions guide the investigation and inform the empirical strategy.

First, what is the magnitude of BNPL firms' interest rate sensitivity relative to the broader market?

This question addresses whether BNPL firms represent a distinct asset class with differential sensitivity compared to traditional financial stocks or the broader equity market, which has important implications for portfolio construction and risk management.

Second, through which economic channels (funding costs, consumer demand, or credit conditions) does monetary policy affect BNPL firms?

Understanding these transmission mechanisms is crucial for both academic understanding of monetary policy transmission and policy formulation regarding financial stability and consumer protection.

Third, how do consumer spending patterns and credit market conditions mediate the relationship between interest rates and BNPL returns?

Di Maggio, Williams, and Katz document that BNPL access increases total spending by $130 per week on average, with spending remaining elevated for 24 weeks after first use, suggesting that consumer spending variables may play a crucial mediating role in the relationship between monetary policy and BNPL returns (Di Maggio et al. 8-12).

## 1.2 Research Contribution

This study contributes to three distinct strands of literature, each addressing important gaps in understanding of fintech firm behavior and monetary policy transmission.

The contribution to each literature strand is substantial, as BNPL represents a rapidly growing but understudied segment of the financial services industry.

First, in the fintech valuation literature, the study examines how alternative financial service providers respond to macroeconomic shocks.

While extensive research exists on traditional bank sensitivity to interest rates, relatively little work has examined how newer fintech lending models, particularly BNPL firms, respond to monetary policy changes.

Bian, Cong, and Ji examine BNPL's role in payment competition and credit expansion, documenting that BNPL significantly boosts consumption and complements credit cards for small-value transactions, but do not directly address stock return sensitivity to interest rates (Bian et al. 15-18).

This study fills this gap by providing empirical evidence on BNPL firms' sensitivity to monetary policy, contributing to the broader understanding of how fintech firms differ from traditional financial institutions in their response to macroeconomic conditions.

Second, the study contributes to the monetary policy transmission literature by exploring how unconventional credit providers transmit monetary policy to consumers.

Traditional monetary policy transmission mechanisms focus on banks' lending channels, where policy rate changes affect bank funding costs, which in turn affect lending rates and credit availability.

However, BNPL firms represent an alternative credit provision mechanism that may amplify or dampen policy effects through different channels.

Laudenbach et al. document that BNPL firms offer 1.4 percentage point interest rate discounts to consumers, indicating thin profit margins that amplify sensitivity to funding cost changes (Laudenbach et al. 12-15).

This study examines how these thin margins translate into stock return sensitivity, providing insights into monetary policy transmission through alternative credit channels and contributing to the understanding of how monetary policy affects different segments of the credit market.

Third, the study contributes to consumer credit markets research by analyzing the relationship between monetary policy and consumer credit availability through BNPL firms.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Consumer Use Report documents that BNPL borrowers have subprime credit scores (580-669) compared to non-users (670-739), higher credit card utilization rates (60-66% versus 34%), and are more likely to revolve on credit cards (69% versus 42%) (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, "Consumer Use" 12-15).

Understanding how monetary policy affects BNPL firms' ability to extend credit to these consumers has important implications for financial inclusion and consumer welfare, particularly given that BNPL serves consumers who may have limited access to traditional credit products.

## 1.3 Methodology Overview

The study employs a multi-factor regression framework that extends beyond simple bivariate relationships to control for confounding factors and isolate BNPL-specific sensitivity to interest rates. The econometric specification addresses several identification challenges inherent in time series analysis of financial returns, including endogeneity concerns, omitted variable bias, and reverse causality.

The primary model specification takes the following form:$$R_{BNPL,t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \Delta FFR_t + \beta_2 \Delta Retail_t + \beta_3 \Delta CC_t + \beta_4 \Delta Spread_t + \beta_5 \Delta PCE_t + \beta_6 \Delta Credit_t + \beta_7 \pi_t + \varepsilon_t$$where $R_{BNPL,t}$ represents the monthly BNPL stock return calculated as an equally-weighted portfolio of publicly-traded BNPL firms, $\Delta FFR_t$ denotes the month-over-month change in the Federal Funds Rate, $\Delta Retail_t$ represents retail sales growth, $\Delta CC_t$ captures consumer confidence changes, $\Delta Spread_t$ measures credit spread changes calculated as the difference between BAA Corporate Bond Yields and 10-Year Treasury rates, $\Delta PCE_t$ represents Personal Consumption Expenditures growth, $\Delta Credit_t$ captures consumer credit growth, and $\pi_t$ denotes the inflation rate measured by the Consumer Price Index.

Estimation employs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) with robust standard errors using the Huber-White HC3 specification, which accounts for heteroskedasticity and potential outliers common in financial returns data. The choice of HC3 standard errors is particularly important given the relatively small sample size of approximately 27 monthly observations. Mac Kinnon and White demonstrate that HC3 standard errors perform better than HC0 or HC1 specifications in small samples, providing more accurate inference in finite samples (MacKinnon and White 312-315).

The analysis conducts comprehensive model diagnostics including multicollinearity checks through correlation matrices, outlier detection using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, and reports multiple model fit statistics including R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, F-statistic, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Data collection draws from authoritative sources including the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API for macroeconomic indicators and Yahoo Finance for financial market data. The sample period spans January 2020 to August 2025, capturing the rapid growth phase of the BNPL industry alongside dramatic monetary policy shifts from near-zero rates to approximately 5%.

This period provides substantial variation in the key explanatory variable (Federal Funds Rate), which is essential for identification of the causal relationship. BNPL firms included in the analysis comprise Affirm Holdings (AFRM), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), and Sezzle (SEZL), selected based on criteria established in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Market Trends Report (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, "Buy Now, Pay Later" 8-12).
